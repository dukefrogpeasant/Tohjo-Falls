                                                    Ash, Misty and Brock come across a lake. Misty gets excited saying
                                                    how it is Lake Lucid. A person in an underwater suit emerges from in
                                                    the lake holding a Goldeen. Two Chansey come and take it away in a
                                                    water streatcher. Brock knows that it is a girl, the suit opens to
                                                    reveal Nurse Joy. Misty gets real excited now. It seems it was one
                                                    of her dreams to meet this Joy. Brock askes her if she will
                                                    autograph his book. She explaines that it was her Grandmother who
                                                    wrote that book and goes on to tell how the lake used to be a
                                                    wasteland because of all the comapnies dumping pollution into the
                                                    water. It was even too dirty for Grimer and Muk. So Brock goes back
                                                    and gets another book. She says it was writen by her mother, who
                                                    cleaned up the whole lake. Now it is as shiny as bottled water Ash
                                                    notices.
                                                    <br><br>
                                                    Close by Team Rocket is watching them talking to each other in their
                                                    Tentacruel sub. The gang watches as some Pokemon have practice
                                                    fights to get stronger and heal faster. Soon a Tentacruel chalenges
                                                    Team Rocket to a practice battle, they loose horriably.
                                                    <br><br>
                                                    The Gang goes into the nearby Pokemon center where there are a lot
                                                    of water tanks containing water Pokemon. Misty asks is Joy would
                                                    examine her Pokemon. She agrees. Misty holds out her Pokéballs and
                                                    says "Here are my water Pokémon!" Joy gets scared. She says that she
                                                    hates water Pokémon and wont even touch them. This comes as a shock
                                                    to Ash Misty and Brock because Lake Lucid is famous for water
                                                    Pokemon. She goes on to say how when she was young she was out on
                                                    the lake with her mom when some Remoraid attacked her and made her
                                                    fall into the water. They all squirt her with water gun to get her
                                                    back on the boat. They were just playing but she didnt know that.
                                                    She never liked them since. Misty is very dissapointed. Team Rocket
                                                    finds a way into the Pokémon center with their Tentacruel sub and
                                                    soon pop out of the water to steal Pikachu. They grab him. Pikachu
                                                    uses a thunderbold attack on it but Team Rocker says how it is made
                                                    out of rubber. Jesse feals a little tingly fealing then remembers
                                                    they just came out of the water. Soon it shocks then and the sub
                                                    partially explodes. A peice flys off cracking the tand Gyarados is
                                                    being held in then hits the button that lets the water out of the
                                                    Pokemon center taking Team Rocket and Nurse Joy's suit with it out
                                                    of the center. But Gyarados is injuured and scared. Ash says he will
                                                    go and calm it down but Joy poins out how he wouldnt know how and
                                                    how she would have to do it. Slowly she goes and remembering that
                                                    she is a Pokemon Nurse makes herself go and not be too afraid. SHe
                                                    touches it and calms it down. She faints afterword.
                                                    <br><br>
                                                    Ash Misty and Brock have to leave. Joy appologizes that she couldnt
                                                    touch Misty's Pokemon. She sais its okay and they all tell her how
                                                    proud they are for her helping out the Gyarados even though she was
                                                    scared. She says how she will always be scared of water Pokemon but
                                                    she wont let it get in the way of her job. They all leave
                                                    encouraging Joy.
