                                                    desert, just sand and rock! Ash though it was Olovine city but Brock
                                                    says that Olovine is just beyond the dessert. They walk around and
                                                    get cought in a hole. Team Rocket gets Pikachu.
                                                    <br><br>
                                                    They get out of the hole and Team Rocket jumps into their balloon.
                                                    James sends out Weezing and uses smokescreen, Ash uses Cyndaquils
                                                    flamethrower to destroy the smoke screen. Cyndaquil has a big red
                                                    bump on his nose. Weezing uses sludge and hits Ash and Cyndaquil.
                                                    Cyndaquil uses Flamethrower even though he doesnt feal well. It
                                                    destroyes their smokescreen and Pikachu gets away. When Ash gets
                                                    Pikachu he lost Cyndaquil in the explsing from the smokescreen bein
                                                    destroyed. Cyndaquil is al alone with the bump on his nose, he
                                                    doesnt feal good at all. Ash, Misty, and Brock look for it. They go
                                                    to a Pokemon Center but no one has brought in a Cyndaquil. Joy sais
                                                    that there is a magical oasis that pokemon go to get healed. They
                                                    don't know where it is but they decide to go find it. Cyndaquil is
                                                    walking along and he falls down. All the pokemon from over there go
                                                    and get him.

                                                    Team Rocket is stuck in their balloon thats hooked on a rock. They
                                                    see Cyndaquil being carried away by Dugtro. Jesse throws Meowth down
                                                    and he's hurt so Dugtro takes Meowth away too.
                                                    <br><br>
                                                    Brock sends out Onix but Onix doesnt see Cyndaquil. They see 2
                                                    Quagsire and they run away. The gang follows. They see a mountain
                                                    with a flat top. Crobat and Noctile said they see something by the
                                                    mountain.
                                                    <br><br>
                                                    Team Rocket follows Meowth who gets cougt by Executor. They bring
                                                    him into the mountain and that leads to a big oasis in the middle of
                                                    te mountain. There is a waterfall and lots of Pokemon. Executor lets
                                                    Cyndaquil and Meoth go. A Miltank comes out. It toouches Cyndaquil
                                                    and uses some attack to heal Cyndaquil and Meowth. Team Rocket gets
                                                    in and all the Executor use an attack to teleport Team Rocket out.
                                                    They were Hypnotized. The gand sees them. They decide to use Onix to
                                                    dig a hole underground to the oasis so they dont get cought in the
                                                    Hypnosis too.
                                                    <br><br>
                                                    Meowth talks to Miltank and thanks her. The gang breaks into the
                                                    spring. Team Rocket bump into the rock that has their balloon and
                                                    they break the trance.
                                                    The gand walks into the spring and sees the clear water and all the
                                                    plants. Brock says that Miltank uses its Milk Drink ability to heal
                                                    other Pokemon. Ash calls out to Cyndaquil. All the Pokemon look mad.
                                                    Miltank yells out and all the pokemon start to gang up. Meoth says
                                                    that they dont want Pokemon there. Cyndaquil tells all the pokemon
                                                    that they arn't trying to hurt them and they think Cyndaquil is a
                                                    trator so Ash goes to save Cyndaquil. Ash says that they don't want
                                                    to hurt them. Team Rocket comes in and does their motto. Team Rocket
                                                    tells Meoth to steal all the pokemon with them. Team Rocket sends
                                                    out their Pokemon. Ash tells his Pokemon to get ready to battle.
                                                    Meowth says that he won't battle becuase of how nice Miltank was to
                                                    him. All of Team Rocket's Pokemon are not going to disturb this
                                                    oasis because of how it helps Pokemon so Team Rocket recalls their
                                                    Pokemon. They use an anti-electric net to catch miltank. Team Rocket
                                                    ties up Meowth so he can't stop them. Ash uses Cyndquil to fight
                                                    Team Rockey. He uses Flamethrower to releas Miltank and Bayleef's
                                                    razor leaf to get the net open. Pikachu uses Thunder to blast them
                                                    off.
                                                    <br><br>
                                                    All the Pokemon dont hate Ash and the gang anymore because they
                                                    saved them. Ash thanks Miltank for healing Cyndaquil and promises to
                                                    not tell anyone about the oasis.
