                                                    Ash, Misty and Brock are still heading to the Johto League. They
                                                    find the end of the desert and see Olovine city.
                                                    <br><br>
                                                    They enter the city and look for the gym. They all run for it. Team
                                                    Rocket are hiding in a trash can. Suddeny they see a office
                                                    building, they want to get a job there for money. There are guards
                                                    at the doors and they wont let them in. The gaurds want to see their
                                                    gym badges. That is the battle tower so they cant enter. It doesnt
                                                    play any importance in this episode, but maybe it is a preview of
                                                    another episode?
                                                    <br><br>
                                                    Meanwhile Ash finds the gym. The door opens and a voice tells them
                                                    where to go. A battle field opens up after the doors open and Ash
                                                    finally sees the gym leader, she is just a little girl. Ash
                                                    challenges her to a 3 on 3 match. She sends out Onix and Ash sends
                                                    out Totodile. The onix looks really shiny. She tells Onix to tackle.
                                                    Totodile uses water gun before it attacks but Onix faces through it.
                                                    It attacks and knocks out Totodile. As recalls it and sends out
                                                    Pikachu. Pikachu uses agility and suddenly someone tells them to
                                                    stop the match. It is the real Jasmine. Jasmine tells Ash who she
                                                    really is. Hee is stumped why his water attack didnt stop Onix.
                                                    <br><br>
                                                    Jasmine talks to Jenina, and she says she covered her onix with a
                                                    water repelant. Jasmine says that she whould spend time away from
                                                    her Pokémon. Jasmine says to Ash that she is not Physically or
                                                    emotionally able to fight. She says her little Sparkle isn't fealing
                                                    well. She gets a call and runs off. The gang is outside thinking
                                                    about what happened. Misty sees Jenina cleaning off Onix. She tells
                                                    her about the water repelant. Ash asks her where Jasmine is. She
                                                    says shes at the lighhouse, so Ash runs there.
                                                    <br><br>
                                                    Ash sees two lghthouses. The closer one is the Shining Lighthouse so
                                                    they go in. Team Rocket is looking at the gang. Meanwhile the gang
                                                    starts to climb the lighthouse. They see an Ampharos. Jasmine is
                                                    there too. Jasmines grandpa is with her. Ash asks when he can battle
                                                    her and she says that she can't battle 'till Ampharos is fealing
                                                    better. The man says that he ordered a powerfull medicine at
                                                    Ciniwood city. Ash and the gang say that they'd go pick up the
                                                    medicine. Team Rocket decided to steal the Ampharos. Everyone sees
                                                    them and they do their motto. They jump in their balloon and launch
                                                    a mistle that opens up to release Weezing. It usues smokescreen.
                                                    Brock gets Ampharose. Outside Jenina sees soemthing bad is happening
                                                    at the light house so she goes to help. Team Rocket gets Ampharos
                                                    and Brock. They float away on their balloon. Jenina sees them and
                                                    uses Onix to try to cut the wire but Jesse sends out Arbok. It uses
                                                    Poison sting on Onix and they get away. Onix follows but they go
                                                    over water. Onix isnt covered in wax anymore so he cant go in the
                                                    water. Jenina tells onix to use wrap attack on Arbok and it is able
                                                    to reach it. They make their balloon go away but Onix is holding
                                                    onto Arbok really tight. They cant get away because Onix is pulling
                                                    them in. She runs up Onix to the cage and opens it up. Brock and
                                                    Ampharos get out. Pikachu uses Thunderbolt on them and Onix sends
                                                    them flying. Jasmine says that Jenina is learning how to use Onix
                                                    well.
                                                    <br><br>
                                                    The boat is about to head out. Ash hears that there is a badge at
                                                    Cinawood city so the gang and Janina run for the boat. Ash wants to
                                                    get a badge there is he can't get one at Olovine now. Team Rocket is
                                                    stuck on the anchor when they bring it up from the boat, what
                                                    trouble will they cause at Cinawood?
