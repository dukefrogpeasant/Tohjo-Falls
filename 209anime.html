                                                    The gang is on the boat with Jenina. They get the medicine for
                                                    Sparkle. Jenina gets the medicing and brings it to Jasmine. The gang
                                                    stayes so they can get a badge. They go to look for a gym when they
                                                    see a Machoke practice fighting its trainer.
                                                    <br><br>
                                                    They fight well. The trainer is trying to train it. It is going
                                                    really well. Machoke uses a really good submission attack and it
                                                    "knocks him out." He is very proud of the machoke. The trainer says
                                                    that the submission attack was perfect. He wasnt hurt at all. The
                                                    trainer asks why Ash is in town, he figures hes looking for the gym.
                                                    The trainer makes Ash march to the gym. The trainer comes up all
                                                    tried. A lot of people and Pokemon come out and say "Welcome Back
                                                    Master." He is the gym leader! His name is Chuck. They eat so they
                                                    can be strong. A girl says that Ash wont have any trouble beating
                                                    her "flabby" hisband.
                                                    <br><br>
                                                    Team Rcoket is hungry and walking the streets. Meowth smells food so
                                                    they follow the smell. Meanwhile the gang is so full. Brock says
                                                    that is is Pokemon Power food, it strengthens the Pokemon. Chuck
                                                    challenges Ash. Its a 2 on 2 battle. Chuck is gonna use Machoke and
                                                    Poliwrath. First he sends out Politwrath. Pikachu uses Thunderbolt
                                                    but it dodges it twice and then gets hit. It isnt hurt much. Pikachu
                                                    uses quick attack. Poliwrath uses double slap and knocks out
                                                    Pikachu. Team Rocket is looking into the gyms cafeteria, they find
                                                    the food and eat it all.
                                                    <br><br>
                                                    Back at the match, Ash is deciding who he should use. He sends out
                                                    Bayleef. Poliwrath uses something but bayleef dodges it. Razorleef
                                                    hits Poliwrath and so does vine whip. Poliwrath looks bad. Bayleef
                                                    uses body slam. Poiwrath is knocked out! Chuck recalls it and sends
                                                    out Machoke. Chuck tells it to use Karate Chop attack, but it uses
                                                    it on Chuck. Brock says that he is just practicing up. Ash decides
                                                    to do it too. he tells Bayleef to give him a body slam and
                                                    suprisingly Ash can withstand it.
                                                    <br><br>
                                                    Team Rocket is now very full. They are laying on the ground when
                                                    Chuck's wife asks is she can help them. They do their motto, she
                                                    stops them mid-way and tells them they can help with the chores. She
                                                    says that it will help them work up an appetite for afternoon snakc,
                                                    so they do it.
                                                    <br><br>
                                                    At the battle again Machoke and Bayleef use assorted attacks.
                                                    Machoke hits batleef and it gets knocked to the ground. It uses Vine
                                                    Whip on Machoke and they both try to pull the other to them. Brock
                                                    says it should put some slack into the vine whip, but Ash doesnt
                                                    listen. Machoke uses submission on it. Bayleef uses vine whip again
                                                    and throws Machoke hard against the ground. It then uses Body Slam
                                                    followed by a razor leef. Machoke is knocked out! Ash and Bayleef
                                                    win! Chuck is still very proud of Machoke. Chuck gives him the Storm
                                                    Badge and says that Ash will do great in the Johto league. On the
                                                    phone Ash talks ot Jenina but she says that Sparkle isnt fealing
                                                    beter yet. He will have to wait a little longer. Chuck and his wife
                                                    say they they should check out the Whirl Islands. They decide to go
                                                    since he cant battle Jasmine yet.
                                                    <br><br>
                                                    Team Rocket is sitting on the back porch. They are happy how the day
                                                    went because they got a lot of good foods.
                                                    <br><br>
                                                    Ash and the gang get the boat for the Whirl Islands while Chuck and
                                                    his wife wave goodbye. Ash, Misty, and Brock are really excited
                                                    about going to the Whirl Islands. Misty wants to see some cool water
                                                    Pokemon, Brock hopes there are some pretty girls there, and Ash and
                                                    Pikachu just wanna see the mysteriou Pokemon. What will the gang
                                                    encounter in the Whirl Islands?
