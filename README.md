<h1><b>Tohjo Falls</b></h1>

Tohjo Falls was a Pokémon Blog that ran from ~2000 to around 2005. It was ran by Matt and co-authored by Raichu, as far as I know. It ran on Brinkster hosting, then got hosted by Pokémon Sky, and then on .cjb. 

This serves as a reconstruction and eventual continuation of the site. Data is pulled from the Wayback Machine for the 2005 layout from the .cjb. directory, and site content is pulled from the .pokemonsky. site.
