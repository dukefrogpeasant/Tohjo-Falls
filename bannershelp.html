                                                            to make a banner, you need a graphics program, like
                                                            photoshop or paint.
                                                            Before you make a banner, you'd better know what size you
                                                            want it to be.
                                                            check out how to make a <b><a href="layouts.html">table
                                                                layout</a></b>! <br><br>
                                                            use the width of your layout for the width of your banner. A
                                                            good height for a banner is about 100 pixels.
                                                            Make sure your banner is not too tall or too short compared
                                                            to your layout.<br><br>
                                                            Now, open your graphics program and make a new file with the
                                                            width and height you want.
                                                            you should think about what your banner looks like. don't
                                                            make it too busy or too plain.
                                                            use colors that go well together. if you want to use a
                                                            already existing pic, make sure it isn't too small for your
                                                            banner! i recommend not using pics that are pixel art since
                                                            pixels look a little weird if too big, and its hard to scale
                                                            them without creating weird looking pixels when
                                                            resizing.<br><br>
                                                            make sure that your banner isn't too bright or too dark. if
                                                            its too bright, it will hurt people's eyes. make sure it
                                                            matches your website design too! if your page is purple,
                                                            don't make your banner orange, that looks weird. dont make
                                                            your banner plaintext either.<br><br>
                                                            if you want to add text, use a text color that is easy to
                                                            read against the background. if your background is dark, use
                                                            a light color for the text, and vice versa. don't use too
                                                            many different fonts either, that looks messy.<br><br>
                                                            once youre done, save your banner as a .gif or .png file;
                                                            jpgs compress your image and make it look bad!<br><br>
                                                            Now you need to upload your banner to a image hosting site
                                                            or put it in your root folder if you want to host it
                                                            yourself. <br><br>
                                                            Now you need to make the html code for your banner. here is
                                                            how you can add a image:<br><br>
                                                            &lt;img src="http://www.yoursite.com/yourbanner.gif"
                                                            alt="Your Site Name" border="0"&gt;. obviously, if youre
                                                            hosting it yourself just do yourbanner.gif instead of that
