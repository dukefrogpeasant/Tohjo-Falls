                          I am writing this because I have gotten a lot of e-mails asking how to catch different
                          Pokémon. Because it would take forever and be so boering to do all 251 I just did certain rare
                          Pokémon.
                          All this information shuld be correct but if you find it isn’t, then <a
                            href="mailto:dukefrogpeasant@Aol.com">E-mail me</a> and tell me what to fix!<br><br>
                          <h3>Suicune</h3>To Catch Suicune you must first awake it at the burned Tower. Fight your rival
                          in the tower and you will fall into a whole when your done. Awake the dogs, they will run
                          away, Suicune will run around you first. Then go to Cianwood city and find Suicune there, it
                          will run away and Eusine will battle you. Then go just outside of the National Park and find
                          Suicune, as usual it will run away. Finally go outside of Mount Mortar and find him, he will
                          run away only to appear again at the Tin Tower. You have to have the Clear Bell from the
                          director first. Fight the three guardians and go into Tin Tower. Raikou and Entei will run
                          away ;leaving you to battle Suicune. Catch him or defeat him, it doesn’t matter. (If you want
                          Ho-oh then you have to catch him.)After the battle Eusine will tell you how great of a battle
                          it was and leave, never to be seen again.<br><br>
                          <h3>Ho-oh</h3>To get the Mysterious Rainbow Bird you must first catch the three Dogs, Suicune,
                          Raikou, and Entei. After you have go back to the Tin Tower where you got Suicune and talk to
                          the guardians. One will give you a rainbow wing (for your protection he says) and when he
                          gives you the wing steps will appear. Go up the steps and get through the maze of the Tin
                          Tower to be rewarded by a lever 60 Ho-oh!<br><br>
                          <h3>Lugia</h3>To get this Powerful Ice bird you must go into Johto and talk to an old guy in
                          Pewter City. He will give you the Silver wing he found in Johto. GO back to Johto and go to
                          the Whirl Islands (not my website *lol*). He will be swimming alone in a small chamber at the
                          bottom of the whirl islands. Talk to him and catch this level 60 Lugia.
                          <h3>Raikou</h3>Raikou is hard to catch in the fact that he will run away. To get him go to the
                          burned tower and awake him (see Suicune guide for awaking instructions). He will run away and
                          will be <b>anywhere in Johto</b>. You cant really try to fund him the first time. After you
                          have seen Raikou you can track where he is in your Pokédex. If you are where your Pokédex says
                          he is then just use a super repel and walk around in the grass. Sooner or later he will
                          appear. He will usually run away so put him to sleep or something to catch him.
                          <h3>Entei</h3>Entei is hard to catch in the fact that he will run away. To get him go to the
                          burned tower and awake him (see Suicune guide for awaking instructions). He will run away and
                          will be <b>anywhere in Johto</b>. You cant really try to fund him the first time. After you
                          have seen Entei you can track where he is in your Pokédex. If you are where your Pokédex says
                          he is then just use a super repel and walk around in the grass. Sooner or later he will
                          appear. He will usually run away so put him to sleep or something to catch him.
                          <h3>Celebi</h3>This is an easy one to answer. <b>THERE IS NO CELEBI IN THE GAME!</b> Yeh, you
                          could use a gameshark but if you don't have one or don’t like to cheat then there isn’t one.
                          You can always get one form a Nintendo thing like they did with mew though.
                          <h3>Snorlax</h3>Okay, first you have to be in Kanto to get Snorlax. You have to fix the
                          generator at the Power Plant by returning the Machine Part to him. Just go to the power plant
                          and talk to the guy by the machine. Leave and a guy will get a phone call and ask you to help.
                          Go to Misty's Gym and a Rocket will bump into you, say stuff then leave. Look around in the
                          water for the machine part. Bring it to the Guy at the Power Plant and he will give you Zap
                          Cannon. Now go to Kanto's Radio Station in Lavender Town and the Director there will give you
                          a map upgrade. Now your Pokégear can play the Poké Flute Music! Go to Snorlax (YOU CANT MISS
                          HIM) and put your radio on the Poké Flute channel. Then click Snorlax and he will wake up and
                          you will battle him! If you catch him or beat him then now you can go to Pallet Town and those
                          Cities.
