                                                            Tohjo Falls was a Pokémon fansite that ran from ~2000 to around 2005. It was ran by Matt and co-authored by Raichu, as far as I know. It ran on Brinkster hosting, then got hosted for a bit by Pokedavid. Afterwards, it was hosted by Sakurablossoms for a little while in 2002, before getting hosted by Pokémon Sky. and then on .cjb, however CJB seems to be a link-through site and not a proper host. <br><br>

This serves as a reconstruction and eventual continuation of the site. Data is pulled from the Wayback Machine for the 2005 layout from the .cjb. directory, and site content is pulled from the .pokemonsky. site and brinkster site.<br><br>

This site was relaunched with the permission of Raichu, one of the original people who wrote for Tohjo Falls.<br>

Original site Tohjo Falls ©️ 2001, 2003, 2005, by Matt and Raichu. <br>
New site ©️ 2025 by Duke.<br><br>

The original Tohjo Falls on Brinkster was closed on 7/23/2003.<br><br>
Tohjo Falls' free layout design site, also on brinkster, was closed on 11/4/2002. <br><br>

Re-launch of the site was permitted by Raichu via private E-mail.<br><br>

Permission was granted by Onelani to use the art they made for MJPtheMaster back in 2001. Permission was obtained via BlueSky DMs.<br><br>

Some of the site's content seems to have been stolen from other webpages, such as PokéDream, from around the time. If you want me to remove something that was copied from your own site, do please tell me. <br><br>
Most image content has been taken from sites that are either defunct(Wayback) or from geocities.ws and Serebii.<br><br>

Old anime descriptions from <a href="https://www.serebii.net/">Serebii</a>, used in the anime sections of this site, have been given permission to continue to be used from their original 2003 incarnation.<br><br>
