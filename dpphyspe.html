                            Pokémon Diamond and Pearl introduce the Physical Special split. What this does is make certain moves physical and some special compared to RB/GS/RS. <br><br>
                            Those games did it with the type as a way to decide. For example, all Fighting type moves were Physical, and all Dark type moves were special.
                            For example, Bite, a move that used to be Special (i know! sounds weird) because it is a dark type move, is now a Physical move.<br>
                            On the contrary, Hyper Beam, a move that used to be Physical because it was a normal type move, is now a Special move.<br><br>
                            This really helps out pokemon that had stats based on being physical but had a type that was special (like Kingler, Sneasel and Crawdaunt) or the contrary, Pokémon with physical types that were special attackers (like Gengar and Misdreavus)<br><br>
                            However not everything benefitted, because Alakazam lost the element punches as coverage and Sceptile lost leaf Blade as special STAB.
