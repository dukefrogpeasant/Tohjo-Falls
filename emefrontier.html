                                                    Unlike the Battle Tower, Pokémon Emerald features a whole new area
                                                    called the Battle Frontier. A guy called Scott(who you meet a lot in
                                                    game) owns the place.<br><br>
                                                    It has various different places, including the Battle Tower.
                                                    However, it also has places like the Battle Tent, Battle Palace ETC.
                                                    I'll be listing out each of them with what they do here!<br><br>
                                                    Also, there are various BANNED Pokémon. These are: Mewtwo,
                                                    Mew, Lugia, Ho-Oh, Celebi, Kyogre, Groudon, Rayquaza, Jirachi, Deoxys, and
                                                    Eggs(which obviously cannot battle). <br><br>

                                                    Onto the facilities:<br>
                                                    The Battle Tower is led by a girl named Anabel. She only appears if you win 35 or 70 battles in Single battles only and she always has Snorlax.<br>
                                                    The Battle Pyramid is led by a guy called Brandon, and it looks like a pyramid as the name suggests. He has the Regi trio and the Kanto birds. The pyramid is dark inside, requiring you to battle people to light it up like in Brawly's gym. There's wild Pokémon inside, but you can't catch them. None of your Pokemon are allowed to hold items, and you can't catch these wild Pokémon. Your bag is also empty. Brandon only appears if you clear 21 floors or 70 floors!<br>
                                                    The Battle Palace is weird. It's lead by a guy called Spenser. Pokémon will move ON THEIR OWN, without your input on what a Pokémon does as a move. Spenser appears on the 21st streak or 42nd streak.<br>
                                                    The Battle Pike is led by a woman called Lucy, and her tent is shaped like a Seviper. You have to go through seven rooms and have to pick one of three rooms. All of these rooms have random effects, from being a battle to your pokemon being statused, healed and everything. It's hard to explain but there's 8 events.<br>
