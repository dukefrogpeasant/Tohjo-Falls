                                                    Immediately after you beat Blaine at Cinnabar, Bill will show up and
                                                    offer you a chance to go to the Sevii Islands, and you can say yes
                                                    and no.<br><br>
                                                    If you say yes, he'll get you onto a ferry. This
                                                    will take you to the first Sevii island.<br>
                                                    If you say no, you can
                                                    always pick it back up later on by going to Cinnabar its Pokémon
                                                    center and talking to Bill.<br><br>

                                                    There is a large PokeCenter with a ORANGE roof. This contains a
                                                    Network Machine to trade with Pokemon Ruby, Sapphire and Colosseum.
                                                    You do need the Ruby and Sapphire key items for that.<br>
                                                    You will also get a TriPass that allows you to go to any of the
                                                    first three
                                                    islands as well as a new Town Map! HOWEVER, you can't go back to
                                                    Kanto for a bit. You cannot use the PC in the big PokeCenter, but
                                                    you can fix this by going to Three Island where the regular PC
                                                    is.<br><br>

                                                    Your first mission is to head to Two Island and deliver the
                                                    Meteorite to a guy Bill knows.<br><br>
                                                    You can take the ferry to the other islands by using the wharf. By
                                                    surfing further south off the pier,
                                                    you'll reach a place called Treasure Beach where you'll find some
                                                    grass, wild
                                                    Pokemon and a lot of hidden items.<br><br> However, there's a VERY
                                                    important Pokémon here which you should not ignore,
                                                    Moltres.<br><br> Moltres can be found by heading onto
                                                    Kindle Road. You need a pokemon that knows the Rock Smash HM and
                                                    Strength, i recommend catching something like Krabby.
                                                    Head all the way inside the spa and your Pokemon will be fully
                                                    healed. Talk to the man by the waterfall and you'll receive the
                                                    HM06, rock Smash. You'll reach an mountain called Mt Ember. Always
                                                    use rock smash when you can, eventually youll find a cave. Follow
                                                    the path and you'll find yourself outside at the path of the top of
                                                    the mountain.<br><br>Solve the rock puzzle and you'll be able to
                                                    fight moltres. Do not bring grass types, because Moltres has
                                                    Flamethrower.<br><br><br><br>

                                                    Once you've got the National Dex and beat the Elite Four, return
                                                    to the first island.<br><br> Celio wants to make a machine that
                                                    trades to
                                                    Hoenn, but he needs a gem to complete it.<br><br> Return to Mt.
                                                    Ember where
                                                    Moltres is/was, and head east to fight two Rockets guarding a cave.
                                                    There are some Braille messages here. Inside the cave is
                                                    the Ruby. Give it to Celio and you'll receive the Rainbow Ticket
                                                    which allows passage to Islands Four, Five, Six and Seven. You can
                                                    find wild Johto pokemon here.
