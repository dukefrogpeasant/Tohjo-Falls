                          <h1>Gold/Silver - Breeding Guide</h1>
                          <p>


                            <b>Introduction</b>
                          </p>
                          <p>

                            This guide should help you to know all about breeding in the new Gold and
                            Silver games. People who have bred Pokemon before will know about the long
                            time it usually take and the tedious activity it involves. You have to get
                            the two parents together, and make sure that one is male, and one is female.
                            Also, they have to be compatible. This guide will help tell you if the
                            actual long process will work, or if your efforts are futile, or, how long
                            it will take.</p>
                          <p>

                            Why Breed? Why breed? Well, there are various reasons for breeding. Here are some of them:
                          </p>
                          <p>

                          </p>
                          <ul>
                            <li>To Get Another Pokemon of the Mother's Type
                            </li>
                            <li>This is the most obvious reason. Breeding allows you to recreate another one
                              of the more rare Pokemon such as Charmander, Squirtle, or Bulbasaur without
                              the need to trade with a friend or use another version.
                            </li>
                            <li>It also allows you to give them your rare Pokemon without actually giving up your
                              Pokemon. </li>
                          </ul>

                          <b>Completion of the Dex</b>
                          <p>

                            A few of the Pokemon require that you breed them together to get a pre-evolution, so, you
                            require breeding some to finish the Pokedex. A few of these Pokemon are the Pikachu, Jynx
                            and Magmar pre-evolutions.</p>
                          <p>

                            <b>Getting New Types of Attacks on Other Pokemon</b>
                          </p>
                          <p>

                            If the father Pokemon has an attack that the child Pokemon, or mother
                            Pokémon could inherit, it would get it through breeding. For instance,
                            breeding Barrier onto Magmar by breeding a Male Mr.Mime with Barrier, with a
                            Female Magmar. It may give you a Magby with Barrier.</p>
                          <p>

                            <b>The Process of Breeding</b>
                          </p>
                          <p>

                            Just south of Goldenrod City is the Pokemon Daycare Center. Here is where
                            the actual breeding takes place. To breed, you need to give a male Pokemon to the Old Man,
                            and a female Pokemon to the Old Woman, or vice versa. You may also use a Ditto instead of
                            one of your Pokemon.</p>
                          <p>

                            <b>Length of Time to Breed</b>
                          </p>
                          <p>

                            You actually decided to breed after all that explanation? Well, here is some
                            more vital information; There are several factors that determine whether a Pokemon will
                            produce an egg quickly, slowly, or not at all. One worth mentioning, is that many Pokemon,
                            especially rare ones like Mewtwo, Zapdos, Ho-oh, and Lugia, are not able to breed at all.
                            The legendary
                            Pokemon cannot breed, and some Pokemon like Magnemite are genderless, and they cannot breed.
                            Also, another variability is compatibility. A basic guide to follow is to
                            match Pokemon with either the same species or ones with the same icon shown
                            under the Pokemon entry on the Pause menu. The best way to know is to look
                            at this site's Pokedex. Ditto are able to breed with all Pokemon, that is,
                            the ones that can breed.</p>
                          <p>

                            The next part is a bit more complicated. If the Pokemon can breed, then
                            follow the steps as follows:</p>
                          <p>

                          <p>

                            These numbers are estimated. Call this number you just picked X. OK, here's where you
                            require some math skills. After you tell the old folks to take care of your Pokemon, a
                            random number
                            is picked between 1 and 255, which we'll call Y. For every step you take, Y is subtracted by
                            1. After Y reaches zero, another random number is picked between 1 and 255, which we'll call
                            Z. Now, if your number X is greater than Z, you will have an egg. If not, go back to step 1
                            above and start over. Essentially, Pokemon will breed fastest if they are the same Pokemon,
                            but, from different trainers. If you intend of breeding with a Ditto, remember that if you
                            don't trade it from someone else, it will take a long time. You should remember that while
                            you're wasting time waiting for your Pokemon to breed, they are gaining 1 experience point
                            for every step you take. So, breeding works best when using higher level Pokemon who no
                            longer learn new moves naturally, or else the Pokemon you will be getting back might have
                            some different attacks. So, now you should have an egg. How long until it hatches?</p>
                          <p>

                          <p>

                            When you receive an egg, a certain period of time must pass before it will
                            hatch. Rather, you must take a certain amount of steps before it will hatch.
                            This amount varies with the type of Pokemon that will hatch from the egg.
                            (Again, this list might not be completely accurate, and is somewhat
                            estimated.)</p>

                            Then the egg hatches, and you receive the Pokemon. What will the offspring
                            be like?</p>
                          <p>

                            <b>Attacks Guide</b>
                          </p>
                          <p>

                            When a Pokemon is born from an egg, a few things are sorted out.
                            Of course, one thing is species. If it's male-female breeding, then,
                            whichever Pokemon was the female, the new baby would be that. If it's
                            Ditto-breeding, then, it would be whichever Pokemon is not the Ditto.
                            The most important exception to this rule is when the parent is an evolved
                            Pokémon, like Venomoth. In that case, the offspring will be the lowest
                            evolutionary stage of the parent. For example, a female Poliwrath producing
                            offspring would produce a baby Poliwag.</p>
                          <p>

                            All Pokemon born from eggs begin at level 5, no matter what.
                            When a Pokemon is born, it will automatically know a set of moves that all
                            level 5 Pokemon of that species will know. This leaves a few open slots for
                            attacks, which this table shows.</p>
                          <p>

                            A baby may learn other attacks which the father Pokemon knew beforehand.
                            Most attacks which the father knows will be passed on to the newborn.
                            Most of the time, TM and HM moves will be carried over from father to child.
                            If you do not want TM and HM moves carried over, you should delete these
                            moves beforehand, if possible, but, carrying TM moves over could be useful
                            if you had a low stat Pokemon, and wanted that TM on a better stated baby.
                            Of course, that's fairly random.</p>
                          <p>

                            <b>An Example of Breeding</b>
                          </p>
                          <p>

                            In this example, I have two Pokemon: A Magmar and a Mr. Mime. The plan is to
                            produce a Magby that knows Barrier so it can protect itself from some
                            physical attacks.</p>
                          <p>

                            Here is what the parents know (These were just some sample sets of Pokemon I
                            had in a box. They seemed to be good candidates for breeding. ^_^):
                            According to the chart above, my number is 32. So, I have a 50% chance of
                            getting an egg (32/255 x 4 = 50%). And the Egg should be a Magby. Of course,
                            there's also the possibility of not breeding by the first 255 steps. In
                            which case, I'll just walk around a bit more. The chart also says that my
                            Magby will have three open slots, and that means that I might be able to get
                            some good stuff.</p>
                          <p>

                            After giving the Old Man and the Old Woman my Magmar and Mr.Mime, I trained
                            another Pokemon It doesn't matter what I did, as long as I was moving
                            around. You will know your Pokémon have bred when the Old Man stands outside
                            the back door of his house.</p>
                          <p>

                            After a long while, I finally receive my Egg. The chart shows that I need
                            about 6500 steps to hatch this Magby egg. After about that long, out pops my
                            newest Pokémon.</p>
