                            must have empathy with their Pokémon to be a successful Trainer...but
                            sometimes it's difficult to tell just how happy your Pokémon are,
                            and how much they like or dislike your actions involving them.
                            <br>&nbsp; Hi, my name is Erika, and I specialize in Pokémon Empathy!&nbsp;
                            Being a gardener and florist extrodinaire, I can tell how sensitive my
                            Grass Pokémon are to foods that I give them and to how I use them
                            in battle.&nbsp; I have been asked to come here and teach you about Happiness
                            and how it is affected by your actions.&nbsp; I will also clear up some
                            old myths like, "Give your Pokémon a Potion and use it in every
                            battle to make it happy" and "Don't put your Pokémon in the PC Box,
                            or it will become sad."

                                    gameplay.&nbsp; From effecting the attack power of "Return" and "Frustration",
                                    to defining breedability, happiness is something that you should keep an
                                    eye on.
                                    <br>&nbsp; But just how happy <i>is</i> your Pokémon?&nbsp; You
                                    can't look at your Pokémon's stats, and see "Happiness" listed right
                                    under Attack and Defense.&nbsp; In fact, it's impossible to pinpoint the
                                    exact stat value of Happiness without a bit of work.&nbsp; However, there
                                    is a way to find out the approximate range of your Pokémon's Happiness,
                                    as well as how to lower it and raise it.
                                    <p>&nbsp; In Goldenrod City, there is a girl who will tell you how happy
                                      your Pokémon is.&nbsp; This doesn't tell the exact numeric value
                                      of Happiness, but you can use the chart below to determine the approximate
                                      value based on what the girl tells you about your Pokémon's Happiness.

                                    <p>&nbsp; So, what are the best ways to raise Happiness?&nbsp; Well, Doping
                                      items, such as Calcium and Iron, also raise Effort Value, so that's raising
                                      two things with one item.&nbsp; You can use up to 10 of each Doping item,
                                      raising Happiness up to 50 points per 10 Doping items used.&nbsp; With
                                      5 different types of Doping items, you can raise the Happiness up to 250
                                      points or higher, exceeding evolutionary requirements.
                                      <br>&nbsp; However, another way is to battle the Elite Four and Lance.&nbsp;
                                      You'll also get EXP and money as well.
