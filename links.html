                          Here is my credit page. Some people know that I cant draw (I can draw but I dont have a
                          scanner!)
                          my own pics so they wonder where the pics came from! I use all my pics with permission but in
                          the very beginning I didnt so If
                          you see one of your pics them please tell me!<br><br>
                          A lot of the cute Japaneese style pics are by <a
                            href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030217162743/http://isweb26.infoseek.co.jp/play/koro-n/index.html">this
                            site</a>! I dont know the name because I cant read Japaneese!
                          It has a lot of great art if you can make your way around the non-english site! Almost all the
                          pics on Pichu's Center and Pikachu's Adoptions were from that site! IT IS GREAT!<br><br>
                          Also a nother place I get my pics are from my friend's site, <a
                            href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030217162743/http://www.angelfire.com/pokemon2/onelani/">Kanani
                            Kireihana</a>! She will gladly let you use her pics if you just ask!
                          She has a wide selection of pics and they are all well drawn ones! One of the best things is
                          sometimes Onelani (the webmaster) will let you request a pic for her to make for you!<br><br>
                          Yet another site is the popular <a
                            href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030217162743/http://www.mewheart.com/">Mew Heart!</a> A
                          lot of people use the pics there but I dont use them much because I like different pics. There
                          isnt really much to say, a lot of you have been there and I dont know where I used the pics
                          but I am sure I have somewhere. !!lol!!
