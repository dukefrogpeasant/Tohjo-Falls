                                <td>Hi, everyone!<br>
                                  Yeah, uh, you... might wonder who I am. Or what this site even is.<br>
                                  Let me break it down for you.<br>
                                  I'm Duke, the current webmaster of this site. <br><br>

                                  This is Tohjo Falls, a fansite that originally launched somewhere during 1999-2000. It
                                  was originally managed by Matt. At one point, Raichu came on as a co-writer in 2003 to
                                  help out.
                                  Sadly, most of the archives of the original site date to 2003 or before, and not
                                  later.<br>
                                  Somewhere along the line of 2005, this site went down and you could only access the
                                  main directory.
                                  The banner image of this site and the sidebars come directly from that archive, as
                                  does the splash's image!<br>
                                  I ended up having to resource a lot from older, sometimes equally gone websites, but
                                  also still-living sites like Serebii. <br><br>
                                  This site is missing a lot of stuff. For example, if you check the FRLG page, you're
                                  met with a placeholder. Don't worry about these, because i'm going to write in new
                                  content for these!<br>
                                  I managed to reach out to Raichu(sadly not to Matt/MJP), and I got permission from
                                  Raichu to continue working on this site!<br><br>
                                  So, uh, if you've already known about this site from SO long ago which I doubt, welcome back! And
                                  otherwise, welcome!

                                  <br><br>
                                  I'll be updating this site slowly but surely. You may see some new stuff like a guest book popup somewhere in the coming months, maybe?
                                  <br><br> -Duke!
