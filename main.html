                                  get through these times. I hope you guys had a great christmas and had lots of
                                  fun!<br><br>
                                  I will be less active starting February because of internships and all that. Hope you guys are okay with that.<br><br>
                                   We hit 3000 pageviews on December 17th, by the way! Thank you all so much
                                  for that!!!<br>
                                  With that all said, hold those you care about near, and i wish you a happy new year.

                                  I added the Pokémon Platinum pages. It's not much, and is just mostly general info at
                                  that. I've been a little bit out of it lately, and i'm glad i'm getting winter break
                                  soon. I also added a new part to the sidebar on the right, namely the Cool Sites
                                  section. That's sites i'm not affiliated with, BUT think are cool enough that people
                                  should go and look at them too.<br>
                                  Also, we're almost at 3000 page views, so i'm guessing we're hitting that milestone
                                  REAL soon! Woo!<br>
                                  Anyway, catch y'all later, and merry christmas in advance if i forget to post on those

                                  I will write some extra guides, especially for the harder Rogue Megas! Also, i will
                                  probably write something for Pokémon Dash somewhere in the future. Probably. I think.

                                  more.
                                  I am working on a nostalgia page that will have old images from the original Tohjo
                                  Falls AND restored Togepi Trouble, the original Network ran by MJPtheMaster a little.
                                  <br><br> Additionally, another original affiliate of TF was found, The Orange Islands.
                                  so that one's now in the sidebar too. I will start working on Diamond and Pearl
                                  versions soon.
                                  <br><br> Oh, also, if you scroll down, I found a "new" archive of Tohjo from 2002...
                                  and I did something I haven't done before; restoring the news from the various
                                  archives of Tohjo Falls. You can now see the news from June 12th 2002 to May 10th

                                  That minigame was riddled, and i mean... riddled... with <s>digletts</s> bugs. The
                                  digletts would speed up insanely fast and you could at best get 30 points(40 was my
                                  highscore!) Also, images were outright missing so Diglett just was a ball with a red
                                  nose, which you now have proper Diglett graphics for in the style of Sugimoris
                                  watercolor art for it.<br><br>
                                  The original Diglett Bash was a Java-based game, so that's why its javascript was so
                                  buggy; it had to be RECREATED into javascript. I can't make the original 1:1, just a
                                  derivative of how its code worked.<br><br>

                                  So, what is this site??? Well, to quote Sam(the webmaster): "This site is a recreation
                                  of the original English MewHeart.
                                  I'm writing the code myself and re-using assets from the original site to create a
                                  copy.
                                  I'd like this recreation to be a functioning archive of the original English
                                  Mewheart."

                                  <br><br>
                                  They are NOT the original mewheart, by the way! As said above, it's a recreation and

                                  I wasn't planning on making that page at ALL. I was initially gonna write Entei's

                                  So, I, uh. Ended up writing Deoxys's page instead. It's a LONG, LONG read. Very
                                  long.<br><br>
                                  On another note, I also updated the homepage a bit. You now have backgrounds at the
                                  titles of each post, like this site used to have in 2003. I'm STILL fixing
                                  inconsistensies and stuff so, uh, yeah.<br><br>
                                  Tohjo Falls has been a fun thing to work on the last few days, and I'm very likely
                                  continuing and not stopping soon. Feel free to E-Mail me for affiliation through

                                <td>Hi, everyone!<br>
                                  Yeah, uh, you... might wonder who I am. Or what this site even is.<br>
                                  Let me break it down for you.<br>
                                  I'm Duke, the current webmaster of this site. <br><br>

                                  This is Tohjo Falls, a fansite that originally launched somewhere during 1999-2000. It
                                  was originally managed by Matt. At one point, Raichu came on as a co-writer in 2003 to
                                  help out.
                                  Sadly, most of the archives of the original site date to 2003 or before, and not
                                  later.<br>
                                  Somewhere along the line of 2005, this site went down and you could only access the
                                  main directory.
                                  The banner image of this site and the sidebars come directly from that archive, as
                                  does the splash's image!<br>
                                  I ended up having to resource a lot from older, sometimes equally gone websites, but
                                  also still-living sites like Serebii. <br><br>
                                  This site is missing a lot of stuff. For example, if you check the FRLG page, you're
                                  met with a placeholder. Don't worry about these, because i'm going to write in new
                                  content for these!<br>
                                  I managed to reach out to Raichu(sadly not to Matt/MJP), and I got permission from
                                  Raichu to continue working on this site!<br><br>
                                  So, uh, if you've already known about this site from SO long ago which I doubt,
                                  welcome back! And
                                  otherwise, welcome!

                                  <br><br>
                                  I'll be updating this site slowly but surely. You may see some new stuff like a guest
                                  book popup somewhere in the coming months, maybe?

                                  said
                                  how ti was fake. Well when I was talkin to The3Eyed1 I was shown that at the bottom of
                                  the pic
                                  it says <i>"For Illustration Use Only"</i>. So that pic was made just so that EB Games
                                  would
                                  have a picture to put where it usually pits the pics of its merchandise. It is in no
                                  way a real
                                  picture of the game.<br><br>But for the new info. The3Eyed1 also pointed out how EB
                                  Games said
                                  it will ship the game if you pre-ordered it on May 1st, 200<b>3</b>. So there probably
                                  isnt any
                                  rush in ordering one!</td>
