<center><font size="5" face="Arial"><b>Revelation Lugia</b></font><br>
<blockquote><font size="2" face="arial">Jirarudan is a pokemon collector out to capture the most rare and mysterious Pokemon of all, Lugia. No one has ever see it, but it is written that it will appear when all three of the Legendary Birds are brought together in one place. It is for this reason that each bird has its own Island.<p>
Jirarudan approaches the Island of Fire in the Hikoukyu. He attacks it with ice, freezing the island and injuring Moltres. Weakened, Jirarudan is able to capture Moltres using an electric net.The flying fortress moves on toward the island of Thunder, and the weather begins to take a turn for the worst...</p><p>
Ash, Kenji, and Misty are riding a boat (piloted by Mic-chan, a guide) to Ashia Island. They have just let their Pokemon out of their balls to relax when a storm blows in. Their ship is badly shaken, but Mic-chan manages to get it into the port (all but destroying it in the process).</p><p>
Team Rocket are following Ash in their submarine, the Mecha-MagiKarp, and are hit by the same storm. They hit something and lose their rudder. Helpless, they are swept up in a school of REAL Magikarp, which carry them towards the port but land them on the rocks instead...</p><p>
Misty's mom is out on her front lawn when Professor Oak comes up on his bike, commenting on the nice weather. Out of nowhere, a herd of Digletts come down the road, picking up Oak's bike and carrying it with them down the road. Behind the Digletts come another huge group of Pokémon, heading in the same direction, South. Dumbfounded, the two notice that it has started to snow even though it is the middle of the summer...</p><p>
Having landed at Ashia Island, Ash and his friends get off the damaged boat, only to be surrounded by a group of strangely dressed people. One takes off his mask and explains that there is a festival going on to celebrate the Pokémon Gods.</p><p>
They are introduced to Furura, the Miko (a young girls who acts as the messenger for the gods) for the ceremony. She seems to like Ash, but gets on Misty's bad side (she first asks if Misty is Ash's sister, then his girlfriend.) The group leaves the beach for a pavilion where the ceremony will take place.</p><p>
Since Ash revealed himself as a Pokémon trainer (apparently the only one on the island at the time...), during the festival; he is chosen to go to the islands of the Legendary Pokémon to retrieve their power crystals. Apparently, the weather disturbances are caused by an unbalance in their powers, and bringing all three stones to a stone circle on the main island will calm these forces.</p><p>
"Never catch a god of fire, a god of thunder, or a god of ice. If you do, it will evoke their anger and the marine god would destroy Heaven and Earth. The world would fall to ruins."</p><p>
Mic-chan and Ash set out on the boat to the Island of Fire on the stormy sea and Team Rocket hitches a ride with them. Upon reaching the island, Ash runs from the boat up the stairs to the top of the mountain, where Moltres's shrine is located and where he will find the power crystal...</p><p>
Misty and Furura decide to follow the others in a better boat. Team Rocket is climbing the stairs up the mountain when Furura's boat propelled up the mountain stairs by a wind sail jumps over them and into the depression on top of the mountain. Ash has gotten the stone and get ready to get into the boat for the trip back down when who should appear but Zspados! He is looking for Moltres and is very scared of something. He begins shooting out thunderbolts, his way of communicating. Pikachu begins to thunderbolt back, explaining why they are there and what they know. Their conversation is cut short when something from about begins to draw Thunder's electricity away...</p><p>
Above them in the sky hovers the Hikoukyu. Jirarudan attacks Zapdos and he's captured like Moltres and imprisoned in the fortress. Now Ash and Furura know exactly what is causing the unbalance in nature. Ash and the others are now on a quest to rescue the birds from their captor.</p><p>
Somehow, they get on the fortress, and it would appear that Team Rocket helped them. Either way, once they're on the ship, they find the area where the Legendary birds are imprisoned. They're being held by the electric fields that they were captured in. They all notice that their Pokémon are acting strangely and Furura concludes that the unbalance between the legendary birds affects the behavior of the Pokémon. At about this time halfway across the world, Professor Oak is trying to explain the same thing to frightened people everywhere. Ash and his friends free the birds. But they birds are already outraged about their capture and not knowing who to trust, the birds attack Ash and his friends before leaving the fortress.</p><p>
Once out of the flying fortress, Zapdos and Moltres meet up with Freezer. The three of them fly together and create a gigantic whirlpool. The whirlpool emerges from the sea forming a water spout and at the top of the spout flies out Lugia.</p><p>
Furura tells them about Lugia and that his presence means the destruction of the world. Satoshi runs towards Lugia and tries to warn him of the traps and plans that Jirarudan has already made for his capture. Lugia ignores the warnings but allows Ash to hop on before he begins his attack on the Hikoukyu. But Jirarudan was prepared for this and fires an electric cage, the same that had captured the birds, at Lugia. Lugia is knocked out by the attack and plummets into the sea. He recuperates, and continues his attack with the Birds until they finally destroy the Hikoukyu.</p><p>
Ash falls into the water but is fished out by Team Rocket who was out on their little raft. Misty, Furura and Kenij are back on shore watching the battle from afar. Furura knows that Lugia will not stop at just destroying the Hikoukyu however. If he remains free, he will destroy the world. The only way to trap Lugia is to using Furura's ocarina and a Master Ball to capture Lugia in. With the help of the Legendary birds and Furura, Ash traps Lugia in the Master ball, thus saving the day once again.</p></font></blockquote><p><font size="2" face="arial">
