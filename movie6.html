                                    The movie starts with a introduction to the world of Pokémon, using 3D scenes and
                                    parts of other movies like 4Ever and the Lati movies surfing scene!<br><br>
                                    After this scene, a meteor travels through space!. the logo appears for the movie,
                                    Destiny Deoxys. It plays a bit of the sounds youd hear in deoxys'encounter theme in
                                    Ruby and Sapphire.<br><br>
                                    Then, the movie cuts to the moon, which then goes to the arctic with a lot of
                                    Spheal, Sealeo and Walrein being there. There's a professor with his research team
                                    there. He has a kid with him named Tory. Tory is walking astray from the researchers
                                    camp. He's greeted by a Spheal. Then he looks up to see the aurora borealis! We cut
                                    back to the meteor.<br><br>
                                    Rayquaza appears, roaring. He follows after the meteor that crashes into earth.
                                    Meanwhile on the ground, the Walrein and other Pokémon start to run away because
                                    they got scared by the meteorite. Tory falls and is swept away in the Walrein
                                    stampede. He gets really scared and faints. His dad searches for him and finds him.
                                    Meanwhile Deoxys comes out of the impact crater, and there's also a green rock
                                    that's flashing. Deoxys sends out a sphere into the sky and the aurora is now
                                    purple. Rayquaza Hyper Beams Deoxys, and the assistant of the doctor notes that
                                    Rayquaza never leaves the ozone layer. The professor runs away with Tory as Deoxys
                                    turns into its attack forme and attacks Rayquaza with its psychic power. The two
                                    fight for a while, in turn destroying the research station during the brawl as
                                    deoxys throws a psychic orb at Rayquaza but doesn't fire it. Deoxys turns into its
                                    defense form and blocks one of Rayquaza its attacks, and they continue on fighting.
                                    they clash attacks, Rayquaza falls into the water, deoxys stares at the bubbles of
                                    the drowning Rayquaza and then Rayquaza LEAVES THE WATER AND POINT BLANK HYPER BEAMS
                                    DEOXYS! It turns into a gem and falls to the sea bottom... Rayquaza then returns to
                                    the ozone layer. It leaves behind the meteor fragment with the green gem, which the
                                    professor carries back home as Tory is asleep. The professor remarks that Rayquaza
                                    was mad because another pokemon got into its territory.<br><br>
                                    We time skip to 4 years later, where tory is in a terrarium while the professor
                                    fires lasers at the green gem until it is in sync. However they overload the power,
                                    and the laser stops. They have to fix a small component! Tory talks to some aurora
                                    that can communicate with him about a book he read. They cut to the gem. We then cut
                                    to the antartic where deoxys has regenerated and escapes from the ice caps and
                                    brings the aurora back.<br><br>
                                    We finally cut to a train with Ash in it. Team Rocket is following them in a
                                    Magikarp submarine. However they crash into a rock. They have automatic trash cans
                                    in the city, but Plusle and Minun love to mess with these trash cans, however it
                                    falls over. Eventually, a NEW pokémon shows up on screen, which we later know as
                                    Munchlax. Munchlax fixes the fallen over trash can. Munchlax kicks a fixed bottle
                                    and looks dissappointed when it doesn't enter the trash can as it expected.<br><br>
                                    A robot greets Ash and the gang. May is shocked by the random photo the robot takes.
                                    This photo is used for the passports so may is disappointed at it. Ash gets stuck on
                                    a automatic escalator and he runs in the opposite direction, since he didn't know
                                    how they worked. Some people mock him about it. These are two girls with pink and
                                    orange outfits(they are twins), a guy with a headband and a really generically
                                    designed guy. That last guy sends out Blaziken to help Ash with the escalator. Ash
                                    thanks the guy. The guy says that Ash didnt need to thank him, because he just
                                    couldnt stand watching ash look like a fool.<br>
                                    Ash is obviously insulted by this. Ash challenges him to a battle. The generic guy
                                    is called Ray. A purple-haired girl named Rebecca appears, mocking Ray instead.
                                    Brock immediately falls in love with her as he does with every other girl he sees.
                                    Max grabs him by the ear to stop him. She uses her computer a lot. The guy with the
                                    headband is named Sid, and his partner is Blastoise. Sid calls May "kinda" cute.
                                    Then, Ray points to the Battle Tower, which is this HUGE glass spire, nothing like
                                    in the games. The inside looks a lot like a shopping mall. Ash goes to register for
                                    a battle. A kid is shown getting ice cream from a robot using his passport. Ash
                                    meets Tory in a library. He tries to reach out to tory, but he gets incredibly
                                    scared by Pikachu.<br><br>
                                    Ash runs after him, oblivious to the fact that tory is scared. Tory runs into a
                                    elevator and Ash follows. Ash tries to ask for to directions, Tory is really scared
                                    into a corner and runs out once the elevator opens. Tory and Ash get caught by a guy
                                    that registers them. Tory and Ash register for a battle without actually wanting to
                                    yet. Tory is brought up to the battlefield for the tag team event. Brock tries to
                                    hit up Rebecca. Sid is hitting up May. Tory reveals he has NO Pokémon, and Ash is
                                    shocked. Tory is NOT a trainer! Tory reluctantly uses Torkoal. Blaziken is sent out
                                    and Blastoise uses hydro Pump on Pikachu who dodged Blazikens attack. However,
                                    afterwards Tory does not know how to attack and Torkoal does nothing but get thrown
                                    away by Blastoise and its rapid spin. It comes RIGHT at tory, reminding him of the
                                    traumatizing Walrein that stampeded towards it back then.<br><br>
                                    He flinches as torkoal falls down. Pikachu has to use thunderbolt to protect
                                    torkoal. since the two are pretty much unable to work together, the two pretty much
                                    are doomed to lose. Torys dad(the professor) congratulates Tory after the battle.
                                    Tory just runs away. Ash encourages himself that he'll help tory get over his fear
                                    of pokémon while tory is to help out Minun who got stuck in the trash can. Plusle
                                    and minun thank Tory and are really happy! Munchlax put the trash can upright again.
                                    and tries to kick the bottle in again. This time it scores! TOry enters the
                                    terrarium to talk to the aurora thing, wanting to say something important. Hes very
                                    happy. He's happy he helped a pokemon out of the trash can! Meanwhile, Deoxys is
                                    flying RIGHT at the city! It fires off the aurora, which everyone notes as being
                                    weird. Deoxys appears on top of the battle tower. Ash stalks Tory because he doesn't
                                    give up. Meanwhile TeamRocket is starving since they have no Passport. A security
                                    bot appears as they try to steal hamburgers from a vendor bot. Jessie gets zapped!
                                    Also, ash is kinda mean to Tory. Brock does a picknick with the others including
                                    TOry to calm them down. Brock feeds the wild Pokémon and Tory runs away after
                                    failing to pet Pikachu. Meanwhile, MUNCHLAX comes to eat all their lucnh! It jumps
                                    up super high. Plusle and Minun appear and they eat together with Pikachu. <br><br>
                                    Meanwhile, DEOXYS APPEARS and attacks the murkrows present at the fountain. Deoxys
                                    messes up the escalators and fountain and lights with its powers. The security
                                    system finally ends up going down as it releases the aurora above the Battle tower.
                                    Rebecca sees this and is confused. Brock is hitting her up again.<br><br>
                                    Tory shows up with pokemon cookies and the Pokémon get to play! Tory warms up to
                                    Pokémon a little. He smiles. We get a montage of pokémon playing. Rebecca actually
                                    investigates the weird aurora while the others play. Team Rocket appears to FINALLY
                                    steal some food, but then munchlax appears to steal the food and walks over Jessie.
                                    They follow Munchlax around! The aurora disappears because Deoxys BLASTS away the
                                    Seel and Dewgong. It uses phsychic waves. Rayquaza notices the return and flies from
                                    the north pole ALL the way to the town. Tory confesses hes never played with other
                                    friends before and tries petting pikachu again, but Corphish appears to jumpscare
                                    Tory. Tory goes to the lab and shows off the aurora! Rebecca reveals her metagross.
                                    the aurora looks at all the pokemon that get sent out. and the people. Rebcca just
                                    follows the aurora around to investigate it while Rayquaza appears. The professor
                                    realizes DEOXYS IS BACK!!! And Rayquaza is coming! Deoxys messes up the system
                                    somehow with its psybeam. People are evacuated from laruse city. Ferries and trains
                                    get people to leave. THe others are alarmed too, but they're still in the garden.
                                    Everyone is told to evacuate. TOry notices the system is down.<br><br>
                                    The system eventually reboots as his dad is forced away from the city. He falls into
                                    the water. Deoxys appears in front of team rocket and makes a lot of Double Team
                                    clones to abduct people. Rayquaza appears to fight Deoxys again. Deoxys becomes
                                    Defense Forme to protect itself. A barrier forms and shuts down all power. The
                                    robots shut down too. Rayquaza tries to get int through the forcefield and
                                    eventually destroys the force field with its hyper Beams. Blastoise and sid
                                    eventually open the door but Deoxys appears at the garden as they finally escape.
                                    Blastoise and sid are abducted the deoxys die when they get hit by a attack. Tory
                                    gets them to the underground exit. They thankfully escape to the underground exit as
                                    Deoxyses swarm in. Ash nearly gets caught but Pikachu saves him.<br><br>
                                    They eventually escape. Plusle and Minun and the other wild pokemon have to escape
                                    from the Deoxys, and the two end up with Munchlax who are also hiding from the
                                    Deoxys. Eventually they notice the Pokémon balls don't work anymore. Yuko, the
                                    assistant, explains the story of Deoxys from 4 years ago. Plusle and Minun jumpscare
                                    the gang as they break in through a air vent with Munchlax. Munchlax gets stuck. The
                                    little guys try to help. the sandwiches show up too! Plusle and Minun run up to
                                    tory. Munchlax tries to share food but after scratching its back, they don't want it
                                    anymore. Ash tries to find food and water. Pikachu shocks a hotdog machine to get it
                                    working again. and hot dogs pop out. they take these back to the base as the Deoxys
                                    come swarming at them all to grab them, but Minun gets captured. They have to escape
                                    back. Plusle is visibly sad and tory blames himself. He's scared. Everyone's a bit
                                    sad. Brock finds water. Tory places Minun in a sphere. The deoxys will let things go
                                    if they don't have any form of movement anymore. Rayquaza struggles with the
                                    forcefield. Surskit picks up the deoxys trying to break in and wakes everyone up.
                                    Munchlax ate all the hotdogs. Deoxys is breaking in fast and they escape in time
                                    underground so the Deoxys don't see them all. They're in the underground lab where
                                    they studied deoxys!<br><br>
                                    They reveal that there's a second deoxys in the green gem! The aurora is revealed to
                                    be that green Deoxys. The auroras mean communication and purple Deoxys is trying to
                                    find the green gem. <br>
                                    The gang ends up going to save everyone by putting the power back on by the
                                    windmilss. Rayquaza gets in, finally, while Ray and Blaziken get abducted after
                                    trying to protect the gang. Rayquaza comes to fight Deoxys itself, and deestroys
                                    herds of the double teamed deoxys that come after it instead. The gang splits up and
                                    munchlax goes on its own. The people are saved by the gang by opening the door to
                                    the place they were kept at, but they need energy first. Rayquaza and Deoxys face
                                    off one VS one. Meanwhile, Pikachu and Plusle thunderbolt the power storage to open
                                    the door going down. Plusle and Minun are reunited and Tory cries because of it,
                                    happy. Now, they have to set their plan in motion to restore the power. They pull
                                    ropes to restart the windmills. all the Pokémon help out, too! Water Pokémon blast
                                    the blades to turn them, Metagross makes it spin using psychic powers, and flying
                                    pokemon use winds. Meanwhile Team Rocket helps by peddling on a bike. They use the
                                    power to reawaken the green gem of deoxys. <br><br>
                                    Pikachu, Plusle and Minun help out with the power department once they realize they
                                    don't have enough power, and the laser works to regenerate Deoxys! Deoxys wakes up
                                    successfully out of the rock, however the glass shatters. Deoxys flies Ash and Tory
                                    along with it to explore the skies. Rayquaza wraps Deoxys around it into the ground.
                                    the barrier breaks. the security system goes back on as the power is fully back now,
                                    Deoxys throws rocks at Rayquaza while it turns into Attack form. the two duke it out
                                    in the city, with a lot of destruction to follow. Green gem deoxys comes to stop
                                    Deoxys from killing Rayquaza by using Protect in its Defense form. the two exchange
                                    beams and meet each other. A beautiful aurora appears above the city that's green,
                                    and the purple one follows suit after going back to normal form. The deoxys form
                                    hands showing theyre peaceful now. the auroras merge. Rayquaza is not done with
                                    Deoxys yet though and bursts out of the rubble to go after both now. Ash calls for
                                    rayqaza to stop but it does not listen. Deoxys saves the duo from being squashed by
                                    Rayquaza falling into a building.<br><br>
                                    The security system malfunctions and becomes evil, as the cubes engulf the city. The
                                    two Deoxys protect Rayquaza as they get engulfed by the blocks. Ash and Tory end up
                                    having to get the chief bot to scan their passes to go back to normal. They use a
                                    hotdog machine as a platform. Munchlax appears... and EVOLVES! Into snorlax. Snorlax
                                    is used as a platform to climb up to the tower to get the chief bot using the
                                    blocks. Ash parkours after pikachu does. However, ash drops his passport and has to
                                    catch torys, which he fails to. Pikachu sacrifices himself as the blocks pour into
                                    the battle tower to bounce the card back. ash scans Tory's passport, and the defense
                                    system shuts down. Plusle and Minun fall, but thankfully Tory catches them, and
                                    Deoxys catches Tory. Rayquaza and Deoxys make amends. All ends well as ash floats in
                                    the sky from deoxyses powers. The Deoxys leave! However, team Rocket is still
                                    peddling for power, unaware it's all okay now.<br><br>
                                    The credits scene shows ash leaving, and Tory now has Plusle and Minun as his
                                    Pokémon! Rebecca sticks around the longest with the gang before leaving on her own,
                                    and Brock is sad. The gang goes back onto their usual adventures after heading back
                                    to Hoenn. Oh, and Pikachu and all the other pokemon are cheerleading with Pompoms at
                                    the end. Except the ones without hands obviously. The movie ends with the aurora one
                                    last time.<br><br>
