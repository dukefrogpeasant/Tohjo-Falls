                                                    Some pok√©mon are really stupid and hard to catch.

                                                    To get a CATCH pokemon to appear, you gotta hit the bumpers; these
                                                    are either Lotad or Chinchou!
                                                    after hitting them thrice they appear. i recommend you try to hit
                                                    them from the top so they keep bouncing around.
                                                    This is the easiest on the ruby board since the sapphire board
                                                    requires you to hit the ball straight up which is VERY hard.

                                                    <br><br>

                                                    If you're against Kecleon, you can hit a tree to knock a devon scope
                                                    outta it.
                                                    this'll make it visible for
                                                    a short time. Kecleon must be knocked over and then hit with the
                                                    ball ten times in two minutes to win!!<br><br>

                                                    If you're against the Duskulls, Two wild Duskull appear at the same
                                                    time. Twenty of them must be hit in order to make a Dusclops appear.
                                                    Then, Dusclops must be hit five times to complete the bonus stage.
                                                    Dusclops can ONLY(!!!) be hit in the back or while moving and can
                                                    eat
                                                    your ball if it is directed towards the front of it. <br><br>

                                                    By lighting up all the four "HOLE" lights at the top of the four lanes,
                                                    the player makes the slots bonus available. This makes the center
                                                    hole open, and by shooting a ball into it, the player activates
                                                    the slots. A slot will spin around and the player can make it
                                                    stop by pressing A! <br><br>
