                                                    Pokémon Platinum has a few differences from Pokémon Diamond and
                                                    Pearl. It fixes a lot of issues DP had, thankfully.
                                                    <ul>
                                                        <li>You can now go up on the Pokégear instead of only down.</li>
                                                        <li>Giratina is the boxart now, and Dialga/Palkia can be caught in post game.</li>
                                                        <li>A lot of the Pokémon that gained evolutions appear in the dex now, but Misdreavus and Murkrow aren't obtainable. A few of these are in the Safari Zone such as Tangela and Yanma.</li>
                                                        <li>A lot of the overworld looks better now, like the resort area now having tiled instead of grass flooring outside, or the starting town looking far more snowy.</li>
                                                        <li>There are more fire types, such as Houndour, in the Pokédex now, making it much more easy to actually get a fire type instead of being just locked to Chimchar and Ponyta.</li>
                                                        <li>Some of the gyms were fixed up to make more sense. Fantina's gym went from a math puzzle(?!) to a place with flashlights, and is now the third gym.</li>
                                                        <li>Gardenias gym also isn't a forest maze anymore, but now a flower clock.</li>
                                                        <li>Maylenes gym also was fixed a little so it's actually punching bags instead of wood panels.</li>
                                                        <li>You can buy more than one single honey at once.</li>
                                                        <li>Hypnosis accuracy is back down to 60. If you're fighting against a DP player, it'll stay 60.</li>
                                                        <li><strong>THE BATTLE FRONTIER IS BACK.</strong></li>
