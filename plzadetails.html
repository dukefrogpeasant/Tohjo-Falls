                                                    I'm gonna be talking about all the easter eggs and neat little
                                                    things here.<br><br>
                                                    <strong>The Music</strong><br>
                                                    There's slightly different music in Lumiose itself, in each zone
                                                    that the map is divided by.<br><br>

                                                    Magenta District and the center of Lumiose(Centrico Plaza) has
                                                    accordions.<br>
                                                    Rouge District has trumpets.<br>
                                                    Jaune District has french horn.<br>
                                                    Vert District has bassoon.<br>
                                                    Bleu District has flute.<br>
                                                    This is all for the main motif you hear throughout the city.<br>
                                                    <br>

                                                    <strong>Leaving Lumiose City</strong><br>
                                                    You can try to leave Lumiose if you want to. This is done by walking
                                                    up to the train station and going through three prompts of leaving,
                                                    trying to guilt trip you into staying. you then board the train,
                                                    only to be met with the fact you're suddenly on a bench, with the
                                                    game saying you were dozing
                                                    off... you're locked in here with Urbain/Taunie forever!<br><br>

                                                    <strong>Shiny Pokémon</strong><br>
                                                    You will hear a sparkle sound if you're close to a Shiny Pokémon.
                                                    Shiny Pokémon DO NOT despawn if they go out of range or the time
                                                    switches. They only despawn if you scare them away, or defeat them
                                                    and don't catch them. Around 10 shinies can be "alive" in your game
                                                    at any given time, so if a 11th spawns and you haven't caught any of
                                                    the 10 shinies you found and haven't interacted with, the oldest of
                                                    those 10 will be replaced.<br>
                                                    Shiny pokémon have these sparkles around them, so even hard-to-see
                                                    shiny mons will be easy to see that way.<br><br>

                                                    <strong>Pokémon Legends Arceus References</strong><br>
                                                    There's a lot of references to Hisui stuff in the Lumiose Museum. You should check that out!
                                                    <br> also, in the museum, you can get a free Spewpa by completing the "lost spewpa" quest.
