                                                    <strong>How to get a early Level 24/25 Ariados before rank X</strong><br>
                                                    In Wild Zone 5, go upstairs to the Bellsprout and then back down to the water where the Venipede are(Bleu Sector 1). If there's sludge, wash it away using any Water type move. Follow the water.
                                                    There's a tunnel with sludge blocking off the entrance; wash this away with, again, a water move. I recommend catching a Binacle in Wild Zone 2 if you don't have a water type and didn't pick Totodile.<br><br>
                                                    You'll come into a area with only Venipedes. There's also a exit from Wild Zone 5, which is a sewer pipe. Exit wild zone 5 out of that sewer pipe. When you see the numel guy, go into the tunnel on the left. There should be a Ariados hanging there. It has Shadow Sneak, X-Scissor, Swords Dance and Sticky Web. You can try to catch it just with pokeballs if your level is too low. Be sure to keep dodging and running from it, as your team is likely too weak to take it on if you need it before rank X.<br><br>
                                                    
                                                    <strong>Map all the Pokémon Centers!</strong><br>
                                                    I recommend that, once you get to the part where Emma gives you three quests to complete, instead of completing these, you should go around town to register all the Pokémon centers as fly spots by walking into them. The reason for this is that, during this part of the tutorial where you're given free roam, it'll always be day, so there's not going to be any interruption by the Z-A Royale zones.<br>
                                                    If you want to, you can ALSO do this with cafes, since some sidequests require you to head to cafes. This will help later into the game.<br><br>
                                                
                                                    <strong>Multi Hit Moves</strong><br>
                                                    Multi hit moves aren't a 2-to-5 chance anymore, but always hit a solid 5 times now. This makes them REALLY good as a Plus move. So, for example, if a 15 base power Pin Missile hits 5 times, it's going to deal 75 damage. however, if it's super effective, it's gonna deal more.<br><br>
                                                    
                                                    <strong>Charge up Mega Energy</strong><br>
                                                    Before going to the Battle Zone at night, i really recommend you smash some Mega Crystals. The reason for this is
                                                    because these charge up your mega energy gauge! You can also do this at the Justice Dojo with the Trevenant dummies, though those don't reward you.<br><br>

                                                    <strong>Mega Crystals</strong><br>
                                                    I really recommend you don't endlessly save up the Mega Crystals. You can only have 999 with you, so you should spend them for Mega stones periodically at Quasartico or EXP candy if you've already got every Mega Stone there.<br><br>

                                                    <strong>Keep your Mega Evolution in the Ball</strong><br>
                                                    You shouldn't keep a Mega Evolved pokemon outside of the pokeball for too long, since Mega Evolved pokemon drain the mega energy gauge, even if they aren't using any moves. you can use other Pokémon to fill up the Mega energy gauge so your mega evo lasts longer.<br><br>

                                                    <strong>Outside of Wild Zone Pokémon</strong><br>
                                                    A LOT of Pokémon can only be found outside the Wild Zones, usually in trees (elemental monkeys) or on rooftops.

                                                    <strong>Ralts</strong><br>
                                                    Wild Ralts can be found at a courtyard at Magenta Sector 7. They're relatively low leveled.

                                                    <strong>Evolution Stones</strong><br>
                                                    THIS PART IS NOT DONE!<br>
                                                    You can buy some of the evolution stones at the Stone Emporium(and all after finishing the game and going into the postgame). However, you can also find them as item balls in the overworld at various locations:<br>
                                                    <i>Dawn Stone</i>: Jaune Sector 6, go to the right of Wild Zone 8/Jaune Plaza, then go Left from the first building there and in that street you find it.<br>
                                                    <i>Fire Stone</i>: Patch of grass behind the building block Hotel Z is located at. Also buyable at the Stone Emporium from the start.<br>
                                                    <i>Water Stone</i>: Also buyable at the Stone Emporium from the start.<br>
                                                    <i>Thunder Stone</i>: Also buyable at the Stone Emporium from the start.<br>
                                                    <i>Leaf Stone</i>: Also buyable at the Stone Emporium from the start.<br>
