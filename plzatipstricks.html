                                                    <strong>How to get a early Level 24/25 Ariados before rank X</strong><br>
                                                    In Wild Zone 5, go upstairs to the Bellsprout and then back down to the water where the Venipede are(Bleu Sector 1). If there's sludge, wash it away using any Water type move. Follow the water.
                                                    There's a tunnel with sludge blocking off the entrance; wash this away with, again, a water move. I recommend catching a Binacle in Wild Zone 2 if you don't have a water type and didn't pick Totodile.<br><br>
                                                    You'll come into a area with only Venipedes. There's also a exit from Wild Zone 5, which is a sewer pipe. Exit wild zone 5 out of that sewer pipe. When you see the numel guy, go into the tunnel on the left. There should be a Ariados hanging there. It has Shadow Sneak, X-Scissor, Swords Dance and Sticky Web. You can try to catch it just with pokeballs if your level is too low. Be sure to keep dodging and running from it, as your team is likely too weak to take it on if you need it before rank X.<br><br>
                                                    
                                                    <strong>Map all the Pokémon Centers!</strong><br>
                                                    I recommend that, once you get to the part where Emma gives you three quests to complete, instead of completing these, you should go around town to register all the Pokémon centers as fly spots by walking into them. The reason for this is that, during this part of the tutorial where you're given free roam, it'll always be day, so there's not going to be any interruption by the Z-A Royale zones.<br>
                                                    If you want to, you can ALSO do this with cafes, since some sidequests require you to head to cafes. This will help later into the game.<br><br>
                                                
                                                    <strong>Multi Hit Moves</strong><br>
                                                    Multi hit moves aren't a 2-to-5 chance anymore, but always hit a solid 5 times now. This makes them REALLY good as a Plus move. So, for example, if a 15 base power Pin Missile hits 5 times, it's going to deal 75 damage. however, if it's super effective, it's gonna deal more.
