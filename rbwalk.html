                          <h4>Red &amp; Blue Walkthrough</h4>
                          <p>

                            Basic Strategies:
                          </p>
                          <p class="text">Well, there are two ways to play....</p>
                          <p class="text">1. Get all your Pokemon at a high level<br>
                            2. Have 6 Pokemon and use them exclusively through out the game</p>
                          <p class="text">Both of these seem to work as long as you spend the time to construct a
                            well balanced team. For example, even those guys may be cute, 6 Pikachus will surely lose
                            against any ground-type Pokemon. A well balanced team should include a normal Pokemon, a
                            psychic Pokémon, a ground Pokemon, and 3 other different Pokémon. This ensures you will
                            always have the upper advantage in a battle.</p>
                          <p class="text">Leveling Weak Pokemon:</p>
                          <p class="text">Here is an extremely effective way to level up Pokémon.</p>
                          <p class="text">- First you must have 5 self destruct Pokémon<br>
                            - Start your weak Pokémon off in a battle<br>
                            - Now switch to a self destruct Pokemon and sacrifice it<br>
                            - Keep changing to self destructing Pokémon until the enemies are dead <remember to=""
                              switch="" back="" your="" first="" pokémon="" when="" a="" new="" pokemon="" enters=""
                              the="" battle=""><br>
                              - Since you self destructing Pokémon all are dead, the first Pokémon gets ALL of the EXP
                            </remember>
                          </p>
                          <p class="text">Excellent way to Capture Pokemon</p>
                          <p class="text">- okay, this is an almost guaranteed way to capture a Pokemon<br>
                            - weaken the Pokemon, or make it go to sleep<br>
                            - as soon as you throw the ball, hold B <the cancel="" button=""> and furiously keep
                              hitting right.<br>
                              - this captures Pokemon the majority of the time</the>

                            <br>
                            This is where you begin. You start in your room, where there is a PC. Go check it out and
                            WITHDRAW the Potion. It will come in handy. Journey to the grassy area north, and Prof.
                            Oak will drag you back to his lab. You will be given the choice between 3 Pokemon,
                            Bulbasaur, Charmander, and Squirtle. No matter what you choose, your rival Gary (or
                            whatever you named him), will pick the Pokémon that has an advantage over yours.

                            Note: Bulbasaur is the best BEGINNER'S choice. Squirtle is what most people choose,
                            because he will become quite strong. Charmander is probably the strongest, but the most
                            difficult to raise early on, because early enemies are immune to Charmander's fire
                            attacks.<br>
                            <br>
                            After you select your Pokémon, you will battle Gary. Be sure to win, so you can gain a
                            little experience and score some cash. Both yours and Gary's Pokémon have about 2 moves. 1
                            is Tackle, and the other is a move that lowers defense or attack. Use use the basic
                            attack, that should kill Gary since he usually wastes his time on the attacks that lower
                            defense or attack. Once you win/lose against Gary, go to his house (right of your house),
                            to get a Town Map from his sister. Now, you will set off to Viridian City, by going north
                            through Route 1.
                          </p>

                            Viridian City<br>
                            <br>
                            The PokeMart has something for Professor Oak that you need to bring to him. It allows you
                            to use the Pokedex and allow you to play linked games or trade. Bring Oak's Parcel (that's
                            the item) back to Professor Oak in Pallet Town. On the way back, you can catch two
                            Pokémon, Pidgey and Rattata.. Now, go back to Viridian, buy whatever items you feel is
                            neccessary from the Pokemart (just some pokeballs, potions, and maybe antidotes) and go
                            through Route 2 to get to the Viridian Forest.<br>
                            <br>
                            Viridian Forest<br>
                            <br>
                            Here, you will face many trainers. Don't worry, this can be a good thing. It builds up
                            experience real fast, and you can catch Pokémon while your here. Building up levels too
                            fast can be bad too, since they won't obey you early on. If you bought Pokeballs, you can
                            capture some ok Pokémon. Depending on what version, you'll either get a lot of
                            Caterpie/Metapods or Weedle/Kakunas and less of the other. If you're lucky, you can find a
                            Pikachu. (Pikachu is really really rare..... I takes a lot of patience to find one....
                            Just wander in grass and fight waves of caterpie/weedles untill you finally see a
                            pikachu... it took me about 30 minutes untill I finally caught a Pikachu)<br>
                            <br>
                            Pewter City<br>
                            <br>
                            Here is the location of the first Gym. The trainer here is Brock. He uses rock-type
                            Pokémon. If you chose a Squirtle, you'll win fast. Bulbasaur does pretty good too.
                            Charmander isn't effective when you use Fire attacks on rock-Pokémon, so over level him or
                            use other Pokémon. Defeating Brock will get you a Boulder Badge, which will let you use
                            FLASH any time and raises the Power of all your Pokémon a little.<br>
                            <br>
                            Note: When a badge lets you use something like FLASH or CUT, it doesn't mean you can use
                            it right away. You need to find a Hidden Machine (HM) that teaches that ability. Use it to
                            give that ability to a Pokémon and THEN you can use it. <br>
                            <br>
                            There are several things to do in Pewter. Pewter is one of the few cities where you don't
                            have to do anything to get out of that city, in order to get to the next one. It's a good
                            thing to talk to everyone, explore suspicious areas, and check our all the buildings. As
                            in every RPG, it will usually end up with you getting rewards and freebies. When you're
                            ready, take Route 3 to get to Mt. Moon. If your Pokémon are in bad condition, use an item
                            to heal them. If you are cheap (like I was), you just have to make the trip back to the
                            Pokecenter in Pewter.<br>
                            <br>
                            Mt. Moon<br>
                            <br>
                            Outside is a Pokecenter. In there, there is a man who will sell you a Magikarp for $500.
                            Do not be dumb like James and buy it.... just leave it alone. Magikarp is the worst
                            Pokémon out there. BUT once he evolves to level 20, he turns into a Gyrados. At level 20,
                            I think he's as strong as some level 30 Pokémon even. But, don't get it right now. you can
                            get one (or many) for free later.<br>
                            <br>
                            Not much to say about Mt. Moon. Find your way out. <you can="" find="" rare="" clefairy's=""
                              in="" the="" deeper="" sections=""> There are plenty of items lying around, and trainers
                              protecting them
                              as well. Some trainers give you special items when you defeat them. Bring items along or
                              go back to the Pokecenter is all I have to say. There is one person who you MUST battle
                              that isn't too tough, but when you win, will give you a special item. There are 2 Fossils
                              to choose from when you defeat him. Dome or Helix Fossils. Either one of those fossils
                              will allow you to get a Rare Pokémon when you get to the Cinnebar Island. For now, when
                              you get to a PC, store this item, since you won't be able to use it for a while. </you>
                          </p>
                          <p class="text">Cerulean City<br>
                            <br>
                            At this city, Misty is the trainer at Gym #2. She uses water type Pokémon. If you have a
                            Bulbasaur, he'll make short work of them. Squirtle does average, and Charmander the worst.
                            Like I said, Charmander isn't good early on. If you captured a Pikachu already, he'll do
                            well also. It's important that you defeat Misty, because you will get the Cascade Badge.
                            It lets you use CUT and Pokémon up to level 30 will obey you. That means that your Pokémon
                            won't ignore your orders in combat unless they are higher than level 30. It'll be a major
                            relief when you get this. Explore a little. In this city, there's a Bike Shop that will
                            sell you a Bike for $1,000,000,000 (or was it 1 mil?). Don't buy it! You can get a coupon
                            which is good for a free bike in the next town. There's a house with a cop blocking it.
                            This will be important later. Gary is lurking around, so be prepared to fight. He's at the
                            bridge. There's a few trainers on the bridge that you must defeat to get to Bill's Sea
                            Cottage. Defeat them and get a prize.<br>
                            <br>
                            Sea Cottage<br>
                            <br>
                            Bill, the Pokemaniac is here. He invented the Pokémon storage system (the thing that says
                            Someone's PC on the computer). He is stuck in the form of a Pokémon until you can help him
                            turn back to a human. Help him, and you will recieve an SS Anne Ticket. As a bonus, you
                            can check out Bill's PC and get the info on the evolved forms of Evee. Now that you've
                            helped him, when you go to a PC, it will now say Bill's PC instead of someone's PC. Return
                            to Cerulean City when you're all wrapped up.<br>
                            <br>
                            Cerulean City (Part II)<br>
                            <br>
                            Now that you've helped Bill, the house that was guarded by the cop is now accessible. Talk
                            to the people inside. They will tell you that Team Rocket messed up their house and stole
                            the Dig TM. He's right outside in the back. Defeat him, get the TM, and return it. You'll
                            get it as a reward. Go out to the back of the house again, and travel South. There's 3
                            buildings there. There's a daycare center, here, you can leave a Pokémon and have the
                            person raise it's level. You will be charged $100 minimum. You have to leave it there for
                            a while. For every level it's raised, it will cost you another $100. The daycare center is
                            great for low-level Pokémon. They improve faster than a Pokémon who is already strong.
                            There is a second building to the right. It has an underground tunnel that will take you
                            to Vermilion City and the SS Anne. Below the daycare center is the city gates. This one
                            leads to Saffron City, which is between Cerulean and Vermilion City on the Map. You can't
                            really go though yet. City gates are everywhere, and are not usable until you do a favor
                            for the guards.<br>
                            <br>
                            Vermilion City<br>
                            <br>
                            Vermilion is the location of Gym #3. The leader is known as Lt. Surge. He uses Electric
                            Pokémon. Electric Pokémon suck against Grass Pokémon. Water will last the shortest. Fire
                            fights average. Defeating Surge will get you the Lightning Badge. It increases your
                            Pokémon's speed slightly, and lets you use FLY. You won't be able to get to Surge however,
                            until you get the CUT HM (see SS Anne). Vermilion has some neat stuff. Check out all the
                            buidlings you can. There's even a Pokémon club. Going there will get you a Bike Voucher.
                            Take it back to the bike shop in Cerulean to get a free Bike. Now, traveling is a breeze.
                            Put it at the top of your item list, since you will use it a lot. Bike's can be used only
                            outdoors and in caves. Go back to Vermilion City and get a fishing rod from the old man in
                            the house near the SS Anne. Now you can get unlimited Magic Karps when you fish in water.
                            Fish up a "Magic Krap" and leave it at the daycare.... Now go back and board the
                            SS Anne. <br>
                            <br>
                            SS Anne<br>
                            <br>
                            I hope you brought some items along, because you will have many opponents to face. This is
                            mostly optional though. But it's best to do so to get some items and experience. Most of
                            the SS Anne's passengers quarters have trainers who will fight you. Almost all of them use
                            Water Pokémon also. There are many visible items as well as hidden items to search for in
                            the rooms. Gary is on the ship too. Try to stock up on recovery items because you are not
                            permitted to leave the ship often to go to the Pokecenter. You MIGHT be able to get off
                            once, but if you try again, the ship might just leave before you accomplish an important
                            goal. The Captain of the ship is sick. Help him <rub rub??!!="">, and get the CUT HM.
                              If you don't get it before the SS Anne leaves, you never will. And, you will be stuck
                              forever. Save before you board the ship just to be safe. Getting the CUT HM lets you figt
                              Lt Surge by the way.</rub>

                            Vermilion City (Part II)<br>
                            <br>
                            Now that you have the CUT HM, teach it to one of your Pokémon. I don't know who can be
                            taught for sure, but I know ground-type can be taught (like Sandshrew), Charmander,
                            grass-type (Bulbasaur), and a few others. Know one really knows how they are limited. The
                            good thing about HMs is that they can be used an unlimited amount of times, where as with
                            TMs, you can only use them once, and many of them you will only find 1 of in the game. CUT
                            can also be used as an attack in combat, but it is pretty weak (it's ideal for weakening
                            Pokémon to capture in my opinion). BE sure to use it on a PokémonFight Surge and win the
                            badge. East of Vermilion City is Diglett's Cave.<br>
                            <br>
                            Diglett's Cave<br>
                            <br>
                            This is a short path that will take you back to a special part of Pewter City that you
                            couldn't reach before, unless you returned their and used CUT. Diglett's cave is filled
                            with yup, you guessed it-Digletts. Very few Dugtrios are in there, but they are hard to
                            capture anyways. You should try and capture one. They are great. At a certain level, they
                            learn DIG which is a skill you can use in and out of combat. Out of combat, you can use it
                            like an Escape Rope and get it out of Caves and some buildings, and will take you back to
                            the Pokecenter you visited last. DIG in combat is a devatating attack. It can often be a
                            1-hit kill move. Beware, Diglett is a ground-type, which means it will die with just a
                            splash of water.<br>
                            <br>
                            Pewter City (from Diglett's Cave or using CUT ability)<br>
                            <br>
                            Here, you will get the FLASH HM from one of Oak's Aides in one of the houses. He will give
                            it to you AFTER you catch a certain amount of Pokémon. Also, you can get many items that
                            you missed because you didn't have CUT before. Now go back to Cerulean City so you can get
                            to Rock Tunnel. With the CUT ability, use it right next to the museum. It will take you
                            behind the counter of the museum so you can talk to some Scientists. Talk to the top one
                            and you will get Amber. Store this in your PC. It is just like the Helix and Dome Fossil,
                            which can be used to get some rare Pokémon later.<br>
                            <br>
                            Rock Tunnel<br>
                            <br>
                            To get here, you have to defeat some trainers. You will be able to catch some Electric
                            Pokémon that you couldn't find before. Teach FLASH to an Electric Pokémon that you don't
                            like. Flash isn't a good attack to begin with, plus, you'll only use it ONCE to see in the
                            dark at Rock Tunnel. So, like I said, give it to a one of your crappy electric-Pokémon.
                            Flash isn't really an attack. It's one of those abilities that lowers stats in combat,
                            although I forget which. While in the tunnel, you will fight trainers and find items.<br>
                            <br>
                            Lavender Town<br>
                            <br>
                            There's no gym here. This Town is the location of Pokémon Tower, where dead Pokémon are
                            remembered. Don't try going in there unless you want to find out why, the hard way. Talk
                            to all the people and you will find out Mr. Fuji is missing. He is in Pokémon Tower. If
                            you try and go in, on the second floor, you will be greeted by Gary. Continue after that,
                            and you will fight a host of Channellers (ghost-Pokémon trainers) and a bunch of Ghost
                            Pokémon. You can't fight/ID Ghost Pokémon unless you have a Silph Scope, which you can get
                            from Celadon City. So heed my warning, and don't go. Just find out what's up, and go West
                            of Lavender Town. There will be a City Gate to Saffron City (which you can't use, STILL)
                            and an underground tunnel that will take you to Celadon City.<br>
                            <br>
                            Celadon City<br>
                            <br>
                            This is the location of Gym #4. The trainer here is Erika. She specializes in grass-type
                            Pokémon. If you have a Charmander, you will kill her Pokémon quick. You can match grass
                            vs. grass Pokémon if you had a Bulbasaur. Squirtle's water attacks will not be effective
                            against grass, so if you use him, just use non-water attacks. However, since Squirtle is a
                            water-type Pokémon, thier grass attacks will kill him fast. You will be awarded a Rainbow
                            Badge for winning. It makes it so level 50 Pokémon obey you, and lets you use STRENGTH. To
                            get to here, you will need to use CUT on the bushes South of Celadon. In her gym, you will
                            find MANY trainers. Take your time to gain more EXP. Celadon is home to a very large
                            shopping mall where you can buy things for your Pokémon. On the top floor, there are
                            vending machines where you can buy Water, Soda Pop, or Lemonade. If you've been talking to
                            the guards at the city gates, you'd know you need to buy them water. Buy one for a guard,
                            and give it to him. He will share some with the other guards, and you can now go through
                            the city gates. Also on the top floor, there is a girl who is thirsty. Buy here any one of
                            those drinks, give it to her, and she will give you a TM. You can give her all 3. In the
                            mall, you can get a Stone that evolves certain Pokémon. Also, there is a Pokedoll, which
                            will get you an item later, or help you RUN from combat. You can also get the one of a
                            kind Evee by going into the back of one of the buildings. Once you have given the water to
                            the guards, you can go to Saffron. But first, back to the Lavender Town business. If
                            you've been around, you know what the Game Corner is. If you want to play, you need to get
                            a Coin Case from a guy in the Diner. You might have heard rumors that Game Corner is run
                            by Team Rocket. You also might have heard there is a secret switch. Go to Game Corner and
                            talk to the guy facing the wall. He is a member of Team Rocket and will fight you. Defeat
                            him and you can press the switch. It will open a door to the left, which leads to the
                            basement levels of Game Corner.<br>
                            <br>
                            In Game Corner's basement, there are some Team Rocket trainers to fight, and items to
                            find. In a nutshell, here's how you get to the boss, Geovanni, leader of Team Rocket. Go
                            down the stairs as far as you can (4th Basement Level). You're going to have to find and
                            fight a Team Rocket guy who mentions the Lift Key. It will make it so you can operate the
                            elevator on the lower right-hand of every floor (except 3rd Basement) so you can get to
                            Geovanni. You might have to talk to him after you beat him so<br>
                            you get the Lift Key. Now, take the elevator to get to the bottom floor and fight
                            Geovanni. Defeat him and get the Silph Scope. Now, you can identify/fight ghost Pokémon in
                            Lavender Town. At this point, you can either go to Saffron City and get the Marsh Badge or
                            return to Lavender Town to rescue Doctor Fuji. Also in this city is HM 02 which is FLY. It
                            is located left of Celadon City, near the city gate. Get to it's location by CUTTING the
                            bush in the small path that is close to the City Gates which lead to the bike path. Go up
                            and left, through the house. It will take you to a small hallway that is right above the
                            guardhouse. Then, there will be a house. Go in it and the girl inside will give you FLY.
                            Now, you can quickly return to cities that you have already visited without having to
                            journey long distances to return.<br>
                            <br>
                            Lavender Town (Part II)<br>
                            <br>
                            Why are we here at Lavender Town rescuing someone if our goal is to get badges to go to
                            the Pokémon league? 2 Reasons. There's a sleeping Snorlax blocking the route from Lavender
                            to Fuschia (Routes 12-15) and another Snorlax blocking the Bike Path that takes you from
                            Celadon City to Fuschia City (Routes 16-18). Now, what does this have to do with Lavender
                            Town? Well, Mr. Fuji is trapped in Pokémon tower. So what you say? Well, he has a
                            PokeFlute. What's a PokeFlute? It is an item that will<br>
                            wake up the Snorlax and can be used to wake up sleeping Pokémon in combat. Mr. Fuji is on
                            the top floor if I haven't mentioned it already. With the PokeFlute, you can wake up a
                            Snorlax and attempt to capture it. There are only 2 in the whole game, so you should save
                            before you wake it up. It sleeps a lot, so it should make it easier. You can go right on
                            ahead to Fuschia but it's better to go to the Saffron City Gym first. You might wanna get
                            a ghost-type Pokémon just in case (because the Saffron Gym Leader uses psychic Pokémon,
                            which are weak against ghosts.
                          </p>
                          <p class="text">Saffron City</p>
                          <p class="text">This is the location of Gym #5, which is headed by Sabrina. She prefers
                            Psychic Pokémon and will give you a Marsh Badge if you defeat her. It will make it so
                            level 70 Pokémon will obey you. You can't access this gym at first. If you've been to
                            Saffron before you finished up business in Pokémon Tower, you'd have noticed that there
                            was a tall building (Silph Co.) with the entrance guarded. If you rescued Mr. Fuji, you
                            can now go in. Here, you will take on Team Rocket trainers and rescue Silph Co. Doing so
                            earns you a Master Ball. The Master Ball will catch ANY Pokémon, 100% of the time. Beware,
                            you only get one, so save it (for Mewtwo). To get the Master Ball, defeat Giovanni to save
                            the president of Silph Co.<br>
                            <br>
                            If you don't wanna go there right away, you can find the Psychic's house. The person there
                            will give you a free TM. Another place you can visit is a Dojo (Gym). It was the former
                            Pokémon Gym, but lost thier title, and now operate outside of the Pokémon League. In
                            there, you will fight a few fighting-type Pokémon trainers. Defeat the boss of the gym and
                            you get a free Pokémon. He will let you pick between Hitmonchan or Hitmonlee. There's only
                            one of each in the game, so this is the only time you can get<br>
                            it. When you finish off Geovanni and defeat Sabrina, you should move on to Fuschia City.
                            It is home of the Safari Zone.<br>
                            <br>
                            Fuchsia City<br>
                            <br>
                            This is the location of Gym #6. The leader is Koga, who uses Pokémon with hypnosis-related
                            abilities. You can access this gym right away, but there's a catch. There are invisible
                            walls in the gym, so you'll have to navigate blindly through the maze. If you look close
                            enough, you'll notice that the floor has lines going from left to right. You can tell what
                            is a wall and what isn't by the lines on the floor. If they go up-down, then thats a piece
                            of wall. It's pretty simple to figure out. And you can get there<br>
                            eventually if you run into the wall enough times. Anyways, defeat Koga and get a Soul
                            Badge. It lets you use SURF and the defense of your Pokémon will be raised a little.

                          <p class="text">Safari Zone/Helping the Warden</p>
                          <p class="text">If you do some exploring in Fuschia, you'll find out something's up with
                            the warden of the Safari Zone. He's missing his gold teeth. You can find it in the Safari
                            Zone next to the Secret House. In the Secret House, you can get a free SURF HM. When you
                            bring the Gold Teeth back to the Warden, give it to him and he will give you the STRENGTH
                            HM. It is used to move boulders, and can be a pretty strong attack. You can use the skill
                            and move the Boulder in the Warden's house and get the TM. Next Door to the Warden's house
                            is the fisherman's older brother. Talk to him and he'll give you a Great Rod to fish with.
                            You can catch Goldeen and a few other water-Pokémon. If you came to Fuschia through Routes
                            12-15 (from Lavender to Fuschia), you might have met the fisherman's oldest brother. Talk
                            to him and get the Super Rod, which will catch you some better water-Pokémon.<br>
                            <br>
                            Seafoam Islands<br>
                            <br>
                            Not much to explain here. Navigate through the cave to get out the other end so you can
                            head off to Cinnebar. If you try to swim inside the cave, there might be strong currents
                            that will push you in the wrong directions. To stop that, look for boulders in the cave
                            and use STRENGTH to push them in the nearest holes you can see. This will act as a dam and
                            regulate the force of the current, so you can SURF easier and maybe get out quicker.
                            Theres a secret Pokémon in here. It's one of the rare birds...Articuno!<br>
                            <br>
                            Cinnebar Islands<br>
                            <br>
                            Location of Gym #7. The leader here is Blaine, who will give you a Volcano Badge if you
                            win. It makes it so your Pokémon's special abilities increase a little. Blaine specializes
                            if fire-type Pokémon. You won't be able to get into the gym until you find the Secret Key.
                            The Secret Key is located in the building right above the lab. It has many fire Pokémon.
                            Make plenty of room for items too. <br>
                            <br>
                            Also on this island is a lab, where you can finally unload those Helix and Dome Fossils,
                            as well as the Old Amber <you get="" that="" by="" cutting="" a="" bush="" near="" the=""
                              museum="" in="" pewter="" city="">. The scientist there will restore the Pokémon using the
                              fossil you found. It will
                              take a little bit of time though. When you are done with Blaine, swim North and return
                              home to Pewter. Go through Pewter and get to Viridian City.<br>
                              <br>
                              Viridian City (Part II)<br>
                              <br>
                              Location of Gym #8. If you explored here in the beginning, you'd know that the Gym was not
                              accessible before. Now, you will be allowed to enter. In the Gym is a bunch of those
                              spin-tiles that you encountered in Game Corner's basement. If you navigate your way
                              correctly, you will meet the 8th Gym Leader. The Gym Leader is someone you have fought
                              twice before. No, not Gary. You've faced him too many times. If you guessed Geovanni, you
                              are correct. You already know what kinda Pokémon he uses. Win against him and you are
                              rewarded with the Earth Badge. It makes it so Pokémon at any level will obey you. He will
                              also give you a TM. It contains Fissure, which is a 1-hit kill attack. It is somewhat
                              innaccurate, but could work out pretty well with the correct Pokémon. Now, journey West to
                              the Pokémon League. You must have all 8 badges, plus a Pokémon with SURF and a Pokémon
                              with STRENGTH to head to Indigo Plateau. You need SURF to cross water so you can head to
                              the cave that leads to the Pokémon League. In the cave, you'll need STRENGTH to move
                              boulders to activate switches which operate certain doors. If you travel down the right
                              path, you will actually see a Pokémon. Save before you decide to talk to it. That Pokémon
                              is a Moltres, a rare bird Pokémon. You can capture it with almost any Pokeball, but don't
                              use the Master Ball. When you get through the cave, you will see a cottage-like building.
                              That's a Pokemart/Pokestore. If you are there, you have reached Indigo Plateau.<br>
                              <br>
                              Indigo Plateau<br>
                              <br>
                              Inside is a Pokemart and Pokecenter. Here, you can still deposit/withdraw items or
                              Pokémon, and you can still trade/match with other players with the game link cable. In
                              order to defeat the Elite Four (the Pokémon League), you will have to rely on items. You
                              will have to face 4 Trainers with lefel 50+ Pokémon, consecutively. Lose once, you'll have
                              to start all over.<br>
                              <br>
                              Note: The surroundings of the Pokémon trainer will give you a hint of what kind of Pokémon
                              they use. The first one uses Ice Pokémon. The second is rock-type. The third is
                              psychic-ghost-type. The fourth is dragon-type.<br>
                              <br>
                              Upon defeating the Elite Four, they crown you league champion. That is, they would if you
                              didn't have 1 more trainer to face. He defeated the Elite 4 right before you came along.
                              Yup, you've guesses it. Gary. He is pretty tough, but if you have recovery items, you
                              should be fine. Win against him, and your Pokémon's name/level as well as time will be
                              entered into the Hall of Fame. After that, you can continue on an rechallenge the Elite
                              Four and Gary, or continue on with your quest to become a Pokémon<br>
                              Master.<br>
                              <br>
                              *Secret Dungeon<br>
                              <br>
                              The Secret Dungeon is located right next to Cerulean. Go up the bridge and use SURF, and
                              head on downward til you see the cave entrance. This is just a cave with lots of great
                              level 50 Pokémon to capture. Here, you will find Mewtwo. If you can see him, capture him
                              with the Master Ball you've saved up. he's a level 70 psychic Pokémon!!! In this cave, you
                              will need SURF to get to Mewtwo. You will also find some high-level Raichus as well. You
                              cannot get here until you have ecome a Pokémon League<br>
                              Champ.<br>
                              <br>
                              *Power Plant<br>
                              <br>
                              Another secret area you can only get to with SURF. Here, you will find lots of electric
                              Pokémon (including level 20-24 Pikachus). If you manage to find your way to the exit, you
                              will see a Pokémon. This one is a Zapdos, and electric-flying Pokémon (lethal combo). You
                              can capture him with any ball except the standard Pokeball I think. he's rare and
                              1-of-a-kind, so you might wanna save before engaging him. To get to the Power Plant, go to
                              the area North-East of the Rock Tunnel. It's right above the Pokecenter. use SURF and
                              follow the river.
