Another technique is to hit Mew with a Pester Ball while it is chasing the energy shield. It will start spinning in place for a few seconds before disappearing. To keep it from disappearing, keep throwing Pester Balls at it. Do this through the whole level to keep Mew in front of you the entire time.
<br>
After the second time Mew flies at you in its energy shield, turn your camera to the left and up slightly. When Mew flies by it immediately does flips.
