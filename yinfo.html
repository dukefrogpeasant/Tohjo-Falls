                            October 1999 (US)

                            Pokemon Yellow or Pokemon Pikachu is the next series after Pokemon R/B. Pokemon Yellow will
                            be
                            released for Gameboy Color. Unlike Pokemon Red &amp; Blue, Yellow follows the footsteps of
                            the TV
                            Anime series. Which means you start off with Pikachu and your rival Gary Oak starts off with
                            a
                            Eevee. Therefore means you can catch Bulbasuar, Squirtle and Charmander! Also stated before
                            Pikachu will be your starting Pokemon and you can also see him following you. You can look
                            at
                            Pikachu at anythime and see how he feels. Also you can listem to sounds Pikachu makes. In
                            the
                            Yellow Version they have changed Pokemon's evolution to different levels and redesigned
                            certain
                            TMs to different Pokemon. Some images of Pokemon have changed and also now they have added
                            Jessie
                            and James as Team Rocket into the game. Your first encounter with them will be in Mt. Moon.
                            A new function NINTENDO ADDED TO Yellow is the ability to make stickers of your Pokemon
                            using
                            the Gameboy Printer!</p>

                          <h5>Review</h5>
                          <p>

                            When Pokemon Yellow came out in October 1999, it was a great excite for all Pokemon fans
                            everywhere. Though most of the graphics were like Red and Blue, the new ones were great.</p>
                          <p>

                            <b>Rating for graphics: 3.5 out of 5</b>
                          </p>
                          <p>

                            The game play was kind of like Red and Blue... but in Red and Blue, it was fun and
                            challenging
                            (Until you beat the Elite four)</p>
                          <p>

                            <b>Rating for the game: 4 out of 5</b>
                          </p>
                          <p>

                            The game was good for a period, but when Gold and Silver came, this game was nothing.</p>
