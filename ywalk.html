                          <h4>Yellow Walkthrough</h4>
                          <p>

                            Here is a Walkthrough that doesn't just tell you where to go, my walkthrough helps you pick
                            Pokemon teams and helpful tips. Also to avoid confusion this Walkthrough is only for Pokemon
                            Yellow! My Walkthrough is not split into chapters as it's only about how to get through the
                            map and just gives a few tips.</p>
                          <p>

                            <b>Yellow Walkthrough</b>
                          </p>
                          <p>

                            The adventure begins in Pallet town, in your bedroom. Walk to the computer and turn it on to
                            get a Potion. To start the adventure you must walk outside the town into the tall grass.
                            Prof, Oak will stop you, then along comes a Pokemon! You get to see Oak catch Pikachu who's
                            a level 5. Back at the lab Oak offers you a Pokeball that has a level 5 Eevee. Gary pushes
                            you out of the way and claims Eevee for himself. Oak will give you Pikachu, save the game
                            because here comes the first fight. The fight should be easy if you just keep using Thunder
                            shock, if you don't win reset the game because Pikachu will be very unhappy with you. If you
                            win your Pikachu will grow to level six.</p>
                          <p>

                            Get your mom to heal Pikachu and then go up Route one. Head to Viridian city and get Oak's
                            parcel from the Pokemart. Go back to Pallet town and give Oak the parcel and you and Gary
                            will get a Pokedex! Before going back to Viridian city your Pikachu should already be at
                            level 8 if not get him to this level. Go to the Pokecenter in Viridian city and heal
                            Pikachu. Go to the Pokemart and buy as many Pokeballs as you can since you're so close to
                            two healing areas you won't need to buy any heals. Now go back to Route one and go to the
                            person standing near the sign. The person will give you a free Potion. Potions restore 20 HP
                            of your Pokemon's health. Now you need to increase your Pokemon's levels if there going to
                            be strong enough to escort you through Viridian Forest. </p>
                          <p>

                            There's two Pokemon you can find on Route one, they are:<br>
                            Pidgey who's easy to find can have levels between L2 to L7, When I played Pokemon Yellow I
                            used Pidgey through the whole adventure because at L90 His Mirror move, Wind attack and Gust
                            are very powerful and is the best Pokemon to give FLY to. </p>
                          <p>

                            Rattata who's also easy to find can have levels between L2 to L8 (very rare a L8 Rattata).
                            Pikachu can beat Pidgey with one Thunder shock but Rattata is much harder to defeat. Don't
                            catch any of these Pokemon if there levels are below L5. Once you have both of these go back
                            to Mum or the Pokecenter if you hurt them. Now just get your three Pokemon's levels up to
                            L10.</p>
                          <p>

                            Once this is done go west of Viridian city along Route 22 to have another fight with Gary.
                            If all your Pokemon are at L10 Gary will be easy. Gary has a L9 Spearow and his Eevee is L8
                            now.
                            Now you can get some good Pokemon from this area.

                          </p>
                          <ul>
                            <li>Spearow
                            </li>
                            <li>Nidoran Male and Female
                            </li>
                            <li>Mankey very useful for defeating Brock it's a must have
                            </li>
                            <li>Pidgey
                            </li>
                          </ul>

                          Once you have these 4 Pokemon put the Nidorans in the PC. Keep Pikachu at the top of the list
                          for now to keep him happy. Go to Viridian Forest after healing your Pokemon to get a new
                          Pokemon.
                          In Viridian Forest you will find Bug catchers, fight them all to raise levels don't chicken
                          out. You'll find Caterpies and Metapods here.

                          <ul>
                            <li>Caterpie - try to catch a Caterpie with a high level, levels between L2 to L6
                            </li>
                            <li>Metapod - though his level is high he won't have any attacks don't catch one.
                            </li>
                            <li>Pidgey - watch out if your using Caterpie, Metapod or Butterfree, bug Pokemon are weak
                              against flying types.
                            </li>
                          </ul>

                          Pidgeotto again watch out but try to catch Pidgeotto, as it's the evolved form of Pidgey
                          Put your Caterpie at the top and start increasing his levels. He needs to evolve into Metapod
                          and then Butterfree. The last trainer has a L10 Caterpie who should be easy. Get all your
                          Pokemon to L12 to be unbeatable. Heal your Pokemon and head for the Gym beat the trainer who
                          has a Diglett and a Sandshrew. Save before fighting Brock and put Butterfree at the top of the
                          list. First is Geodude L10 your L12 Butterfree can beat him with Confusion. After Geodudes
                          defeated change Pokemon to Pikachu. Onix L12 is easy when his defence is decreased, use
                          Pikachu until Onix's defence is small or Pikachu faints. Bring out Butterfree and used
                          Confusion until Onix faints.<p>

                            Now it's time to make a choice, you can keep this team or you can get a better harder team.
                            First time I played Pokemon yellow I used only one Pokemon and by the time I got to the
                            Elite four my Pokemon was only L50. This time I'm playing Pokemon yellow on my computer
                            (downloaded of the internet) and I've got a better squad. On this day of writing my
                            walkthrough I've got six Pokemon all at L66. I know that's low levels but since all six of
                            my Pokemon are at this level there much stronger then one Pokemon at L80. </p>
                          <p>

                            I suggest that you use six Pokemon of different types. If you train your Pokemon to high
                            levels at the start lets say L16 then they will end up getting higher levels at the end.
                            Think about it, it makes a lot of sense, as Pokemon at the start are easier to defeat, spend
                            a few hours of training, it will be worth it. Here's the squad I'm using:

                          </p>
                          <ul>
                            <li>Pikachu
                            </li>
                            <li>Pidgeot
                            </li>
                            <li>Victreebel
                            </li>
                            <li>Charizard
                            </li>
                            <li>Gyarados
                            </li>
                            <li>Dragonite
                            </li>
                          </ul>

                          You can get Butterfree, Pidgey and Pikachu at the start. Now you've won your first badge it's
                          time to go to your next gym. Get all your Pokemon, roughly to L18 so if your using Pidgey she
                          will evolve. Exit the town and head along route 3 beating all the trainers. They use Bug
                          Pokemon and a few normal and ground Pokemon. By the time you reach Mt moon your Pokemon should
                          be at L18. You can find Sandshrew and some high level Pokemon.

                          <ul>
                            <li>Sandshrew - catch, as this is a rare Pokemon
                            </li>
                            <li>Rattata
                            </li>
                            <li>Spearow
                            </li>
                            <li>Mankey
                            </li>
                          </ul>

                          Any Pokemon you catch but don't want put in the box on Pc. The best way to raise Pokemon
                          levels fairly is to put the lowest level Pokemon at the top and when their levels are higher
                          then other Pokemon change them around. In Mt moon you can find 2 moonstones, a rare candy and
                          4 different types of Pokemon.

                          <ul>
                            <li>Zubat is the most common but can be a pain when they use supersonic beating these
                              Pokemon only gives a few exp. Points.
                            </li>
                            <li>Clefairy - very rare if you see it catch it, else you want to use this Pokemon later on
                              evolve it with the moonstone.
                            </li>
                            <li>Geodude - use Butterfree if you're training one to get exp. Points.
                            </li>
                            <li>Paras - catch since these are rare later fight them for a lot of Exp. Points.
                            </li>
                          </ul>

                          Team rocket have taken over Mt moon go up every ladder and fight to raise levels. At the third
                          set of ladders is an item ball, rare candy is inside. Go up the ladder and make your way
                          thought the maze. Just before the super nerd is a little path to a dead end at the end is a
                          moonstone. If you can't find it use an item finder later on. Beat super nerd to get a fossil.
                          Dome is for Kabuto and Helix is for Omastar. When you go to the exit team rocket's Jesse and
                          James will ambush you. They use Koffing, Ekans and Meowth all lv14. Exit Mt moon and head to
                          Cerulean city.<p>

                            After healing your Pokemon go and fight Misty with your Pikachu if it's over L26. If not
                            then go up Nugget Bridge to get Exp. Points. Don't get your Pokemon to high level or they
                            won't obey you. Save because Gary is at Nugget Bridge he has a strong team now so best to
                            start with Pikachu. It may just be a rumour but Pikachu gets happy if you let him battle
                            Gary's starting Pokemon. Gary uses Spearow lv18, Sandshrew lv15, Rattata lv15 and Eevee at
                            lv17. Beat Nugget Bridge to get a Nugget. Sell the Nugget for $5,000. Beat every trainer and
                            head straight north at the cliff a man will give you Charmander if Pikachu is happy. Start
                            training Charmander since the area your in has grass Pokemon. Get Charmander to L16 to get
                            Charmeleon. Then get Chameleon's level to the same as your other Pokemon levels.

                          </p>
                          <ul>
                            <li>Oddish - not useful now but evolves into the powerful Vileplume
                            </li>
                            <li>Bellsprout - can learn sleep powder, which is great to catch Pokemon with.
                            </li>
                            <li>Venonat
                            </li>
                            <li>Pidgey
                            </li>
                            <li>Pidgeotto
                            </li>
                          </ul>

                          Now fight Misty before going to Bill's house. She has got a L18 staryu and a L21 Starmie.
                          Watch out for Starmie's Bubble beam. When you beat Misty she will give you a TM that you
                          should teach Squirtle later on called the Bubble beam. Head to Bill's house and help him to
                          get a ticket for the S.S. Anne. Renter to see the evolutions of Eevee. Back in the city you'll
                          find a woman who will give you a Bulbasaur. Go to the house to the northwest to find out about
                          every badge. Go in his backyard and search around for a rare candy. It's best to use the rare
                          candies at the end of the game when your Pokemon are at higher levels then now when they're at
                          low levels. Go to the house with a woman standing next to and enter. In the backyard beat the
                          team rocket to get a TM that contains Dig. By now your Pokemon should be around L30. Go to
                          Vermilion city and head to the S.S. Anne beat everyone and get all the items. Near to the
                          captain is Gary but he should be no problem though his teams getting stronger. He uses
                          Sandshrew lv19, Rattata lv16, and Spearow lv19, Eevee at lv20. Help the seasick captain and
                          get HM 1 Cut. If you used Bulbasaur teach him HM cut. Now its time to battle Surge, if you
                          have a grass Pokemon then he/she will be useful here. There's a lock search the bins when you
                          find a switch the other switch will be next to it. Lt Surge use's a Raichu at L28 use a grass
                          to beat him. Go to Diglett cave to Pewter city if you've caught 10 different Pokemon you will
                          get HM flash. Now go back though Diglett cave after getting the moonstone. I recommend
                          training here; as nearly every Pokemon can easily beat these Diglett, just watch out for their
                          speed and big brother.<p>

                            Get Squirtle from Jenny and a bike token, then try going east and battle all the trainers.
                            You'll find:<br>

                            Pidgey, Pidgeotto, Rattata, Raticate, Drowzee.</p>
                          <p>

                            Now head to Cerulean to get a bike, you'll find Abra, Pidgey, Pidgeotto, Rattata and
                            Jigglypuff on route 5/6. Use Cut and head to Rock tunnel and train by fighting all the
                            trainers you meet, including new Pokemon Nidorina and Nidorino and I think Fearow. At Rock
                            tunnel is a pokemoncente for you to heal your Pokemon. Enter Rock tunnel and Fight every
                            trainer and wild Pokemon to get all your Pokemon to about L40. Go along route 8 to Celadon
                            city and go to the Gym. Use a fire to beat all the Grass type. Erika uses Tangela lv30,
                            gloom lv32 and Weepinbell lv32. After beating the leader all Pokemon up to L50 will obey
                            you. Buy a drink on the roof of the Poke-mart. Give to the guard so you can travel to
                            Saffron city.</p>
                          <p>

                            Head to the game corner and talk to the man at the poster. After beating him press the
                            button behind the poster and go down the stairs. Beat all the trainers on B1 and B2. On B3
                            follow the arrows to the stairs to B4. Near the table is a team rocket who when beaten will
                            drop an item ball which contains lift key. Use the lift key on B2 and take it to B1. Battle
                            the guard to open the door and go to heal your Pokemon. Take the lift to B4 and you will
                            fight Jesse and James again. Their Pokemon are all at lv25. Now to battle the leader of Team
                            Rocket, Giovanni, he uses Onix lv25, Rhyhorn lv24 and Persian lv29. You will get the Silph
                            scope. Head to Lavender town and make sure your Pokemon are about L40. Beat Gary who has
                            started making his final team, he uses Fearow lv25, Magnemite lv23, Shellder lv22, Sandshrew
                            lv20 and Eevee lv25. Beat all the trainers who have Gastly and Haunter. At the top you will
                            battle a Marowak don't try to catch it, as you'll just waste your balls. Try to get a
                            Cubone; Gastly and a Haunter then battle Team Rocket. Watch out, there Pokemon have evolved
                            now they have Arbok and Weezing at lv27. The old man will give you a flute that will awake
                            the two Snorlax. Go to Celadon city and west to the bush. Chop the bush down and go to the
                            little house to get a HM fly. Teach Fly to Pidgeot then. Fly to Lavender town and head down
                            the harbour. At the cross section is a Snorlax. Wake it up and try to catch it. At lv30 it
                            may be difficult to catch, don't despair if you don't catch him, wait until you have ultra
                            balls and catch the other Snorlax. Go left and battle all the trainers if you haven't
                            already done so. </p>
                          <p>

                            Head down the harbour and battle everyone to get your Pokemon to about L50. You'll be lucky,
                            but its possible to find Farfetched on route 12/13At Fuchsia city you must battle Koga. In
                            his Gym there are invisible walls but battle every trainer any way. Koga has Three Venonat
                            and a L50 Venomoth all your Pokemon together should win. You can use Surf any time now. Go
                            up the cycle route and battle every trainer, and try to catch the other Snorlax. Now head to
                            Saffron city and fight at the fighting Gym. You can choose Hitmonlee or Hitmonchan, both are
                            cool, I picked Hitmonchan. Go to Silph Company and take the lift to F5. Go to the south and
                            walk onto teleport walk back onto the teleport and battle a team rocket member. Get the card
                            key then head back to F1 and up the stairs. Battle every trainer and open every door on
                            every floor, on the 9th floor is a healing spot. On the 3rd floor is a teleporter that takes
                            you to a small room. Before battling Gary, battle every trainer, as it's the most populated
                            building full of trainers you'll find! Save then battle Gary, his Eevee has evolved he has
                            Sandslash lv38, Cloyster lv35, Magneton lv37, Kadabra lv35 and depending on how your first
                            two battles with Gary went, Vaporeon (if you lost both battles) Flareon, if you lost one,
                            and won one battle, Jolteon if you won both battles. After beating Gary talk to the man and
                            he will give you Lapras.</p>
                          <p>

                            Take the teleporter to the top floor and you will battle team rocket for the last time,
                            their lv31, easy. Go to the door and open it to battle the leader of team rocket. He has a
                            Rhyhorn lv37, Nidoqueen lv40, Nidorino lv37 and Persian lv25. Beat him to get the Master
                            ball. Go to the Gym that's open now to battle Sabrina. Battle every trainer to get your
                            Pokemon to about L55 and then battle Sabrina she has a L50 Abra L50 Kadabra L50 Alakazam.
                            Now all Pokemon up to L70 will obey head down to the Safari zone. On cycling road, train
                            your Pokemon as you'll meat a few new Pokemon, Venomoth, Doduo, Ponyta, Dodrio, Fearow.</p>
                          <p>

                            Go main zone-to-zone one to zone two to zone three. There you will find HM Surf and the Gold
                            teeth, teach surf to a good water Pokemon and with the spare time try to catch some Pokemon.
                            If you got the ultra rod on route 14 I think, use it on lakes, be very patient as it takes
                            ages but you can find and catch Dratini. I did, my strategy was throwing a stone, and she
                            may run, but try the strategy until you catch her. Head to the Warden's house and give him
                            the teeth and you will get HM Strength. Now take the sea route to Sea foam islands where you
                            can get Articuno a rare Pokemon. Push the boulders down the holes to cut the current and get
                            to the exit. Battle every trainer in the water for exp. Points. At Cinnabar Island you can
                            get Kabuto or Omastar by giving your Helix, Dome fossil to the man in the lab. Your Pokemon,
                            by now should be around lv60, go to the mansion where you can catch some new Pokemon,
                            Growlithe, Muk and grimmer! Go up the stairs the touch the statue. Go in the north room up
                            the stairs then touch the statue to open the door. Jump of the big hole and go down the
                            stairs. Go to the middle room and touch the statue then head north. Touch the statue in the
                            middle top room and head to the item ball next to the four plants. Now you have the Secret
                            key work your way out and get water Pokemon ready for a fight. Your Pokemon should be ready
                            go to the fire Gym and fight all the trainers don't try to dodge them. Blaine uses 3 Pokemon
                            Ninetales lv48, Arcanine lv54 and Rapidash lv50 but he shouldn't be hard. Go north back to
                            Pallet town and fly to Viridian city. You can now enter the gym!</p>
                          <p>

                            Enter the Gym and fight all the trainers who use Ground Pokemon. Water Pokemon are the best
                            here. Leader of team rocket is the boss here and uses his Rhydon lv55, Nidoqueen lv53,
                            Nidoking lv55, Persian lv53 and Dugtrio lv50. Once you win all Pokemon will obey you now go
                            up Route 22. Here you will fight Gary who will have all 6 of his Pokemon. Use each of your
                            Pokemon against each of his Pokemon to find who are the best against his types. He uses
                            Sandslash, lv47, Exeggcute lv45, Cloyster lv45, Magneton lv37, Kadabra lv50 and his evolved
                            Eevee lv53. Now go to Victory road where you will have to push boulders to open doors to get
                            out. Battle all the trainers and stay for a while until all your Pokemon are L60. On the
                            first section push the boulder on to the plate to open the door. Pass the door is 2 trainers
                            you'll also find out that this path looks like a J. On the right side you can push a boulder
                            to reveal one of two item balls. Push the boulder to the left to get a TM sky attack or push
                            the boulder north to get a rare candy. On the 3rd section is a boulder over a hole push it
                            down and follow it. Push the boulder to the left to open the final door. To get Moltres, on
                            the 3rd section go up the ladder near the plate. There's a trainer and a bird, SAVE FIRST!
                            If you make it faint you will not have another chance. </p>
                          <p>

                            The reason why I've said 60 is your Pokemon will grow faster when fighting the Elite Four
                            and it's more fun then spending hours raising levels slowly. Spend all your money on
                            Revives, Hyper Potions, Full heals and Recovers so that if you lose you won't lose all your
                            hard earned money.<br>
                            Here are what skills my Pokemon know;

                          Well done now all you need to do is get Zapdos from power plant, Moltres Victory road and
                          Mewtwo unknown dungeon in cerulean city. Keep fighting the Elite four to get your Pokemon to
                          L80. Then challenge a friend to a Pokemon match you will probably win.<br>
                          In the Unknown Dungeon you will find very high level Pokemon like</p>
                          <p>

                          </p>
                          <ul>
                            <li>Golbat - levels from L50 to L59 they give over 1,000 exp. Points every time!
                            </li>
                            <li>Weepinbell - these are rare but are great grass type Pokemon

                            <li>Rhyhorn - catch, as these are powerful

                            <li>Ditto - these aren't worth fighting as they give about 600 exp. Points watch out they
                              transform.

                            <li>Graveler - don't battle until you can defeat them in one move, as they will use
                              explosion!
                            </li>
                            <li>Lickitung - another rare Pokemon they don't give much exp. Points so just catch one and
                              then leave them alone
                            </li>
                            <li>Parasect - a nice Pokemon to add to your collection but has a high defence
                            </li>
                            <li>Venomoth - only gives 1,000 exp. points
